After a failed attempt to resolve this through the complaint process with the energy supplier I engaged with the Ombudsman service.It is a straight forward process to register the complaint and to provide evidence.

Upon conclusion of their investigation a member of the team phoned me and talked through my complaint to ensure they fully understood it, and then explained their decision, rationale and findings which included payments for missed appointments and compensation for the length of time this issue has been ongoing.

BT pushed me from pillar to post, gave vastly differing verdicts to my problems and basically told me things that were untrue. Once the OS became involved and all my evidence (a very important part of any complaint!) was given to them, the service resolved the matter within a few weeks.It’s unfortunate that it seems a vast majority of suppliers have lost the human touch and work from the point of view that the customer is wrong until proven right.I would urge anyone who has issues with suppliers who have been unable to find a resolution, to contact the OS. I’d also add that it is important to keep all records of communication with a rogue supplier as this greatly helps in mapping out the history of a complaint and is your only real tangible evidence.Well done Ombudsman Services! The real shame is that suppliers are allowed to offer such shoddy services in the first place.",Yes,25-Nov-21,"Hello, We are glad we were able to help you resolve your long standing complaint with BT.

United Kingdom,8,5,22-Aug-21,8,3,2021,Case resolved to my satisfaction,"Really surprised to see negative reviews here. I had a great experience with the Ombudsman. In my case, it was very clear that the Plusnet was completely at fault and the service (or lack of) had been absolutely terrible, so maybe it's easier in such a clear cut case. They had already promised me £150 to reimburse incorrect payments taken without consent and as compensation. They never actually sent me this though, and so the Ombudsman ruled they were due me that plus an additional £50.I did find the website a little counter intuitive, and when you have a lot of emails/evidence it's a bit of a faff adding it. Timescales felt a bit like I didn't have much time, and overall it seemed to drag. BUT I've got thoroughly sick of Plusnet I felt that sense of doom and wanted to ignore emails coming through about it, so I could well have put things off, and it had been fighting with Plusnet for 7 months before going to the ombudsman so an additional 2 months to get it sorted probably isn't that bad and just felt long on top of the previous 7 months",Yes,23-Aug-21,"Hi Susie!

United Kingdom,1,5,21-Jul-21,7,3,2021,Incorrect energy bill,"The Ombudsman Service looked at my complaint when I was having trouble with my energy supplier. My previous suppler ceased trading but the first bill from the new supplier after approximately thirty days was not only ridiculously high but both the gas and electricity totals were the same as the final amount (down to the last penny) I had paid to the previous supplier. Despite me speaking to them on the phone about it and writing to their customer services department I was subjected to months of payment demands by post, text, and email. They also sent a debt collector to my home (and added a collection cost to my bill) to collect payment and threatened me with court action. They didn't seem to listen and were adamant that I should pay them the money that I allegedly owed them. Even when we had both sent all our evidence in to the Ombudsman the company were still maintaining that the bill was correct and offered to knock about thirty pounds off it as a goodwill gesture. Needless to say I didn't take up their offer. After assessing all the evidence and trying to work out how they had arrived at the amount for my bill the Ombudsman Service phoned me with their decision and explained everything to me. The company were told to knock over £100 off the bill to make it inline with what it should be, to make a £75 goodwill payment, to remove the costs of the debt collectors visit from my bill, to ensure that there was no mark on my credit rating from the episode, and to send me an apology. I wasn't getting anywhere in my dispute with them before the Ombudsman became involved as they simply would not listen, and it would otherwise have ended up in some form of legal action. I would certainly recommend the service to anyone who finds themselves in a similar situation.",Yes,22-Jul-21,"Hi Andrew, That sounds like a really stressful situation.

United Kingdom,1,5,07-Jul-21,7,3,2021,Very happy with the Ombudsman service,"Very happy with the Ombudsman service.  Prior to their stepping in, Shell were relentlessly hounding my mother, a vulnerable, elderly Alzheimer's sufferer for energy use at a property she'd vacated about 2 years earlier, claiming that she had failed to notify them of the move at the time.  Even though I made them aware of my mother's medical situation, they continued to make direct demands for payment which caused a great amount of unnecessary stress.  They refused to accept notification of vacation of premises from the private landlord in question as proof, and following a request for all records, I was able to identify in their own records, evidence that notification had indeed been made at the time.  Despite all of this, it took the heavier arm of the Ombudsman for them to back down and pay the agreed compensation (which to add insult to injury was initially £20 short!).  So although it makes me sad and angry that it is necessary, this is a very satisfied user of the service.",Yes,08-Jul-21,"Hi Clare, thanks for taking the time to write your review!

So I brought in the Ombudsman and even before the process had properly begun, British Gas capitulated and applied back billing as soon as the Ombudsman case website alerted them to my complaint.

Some calls to B Gas said there was no debt showing on my account and other calls said there was a debt.  After three months of frustration dealing with different people, having to start from scratch with every phone call, being cut off, transferred to different departments, never receiving any of the return phone calls, texts or emails that I was promised I eventually  registered a formal complaint with British Gas.  This made absolutely no difference and it wasn't until I involved the Ombudsman that British Gas started treating me as an individual with personal correspondance rather than automated responses.    Beth at the Ombudsman Services dealt with my case and ploughed through the pages of evidence I submitted.  Her concluding report was detailed and broke down thoroughly each of the grievances I had raised.   The outcome was my switch to Bulb went through, the alleged debt was removed, a letter of apology was received from British Gas and a £75 goodwill cheque was sent to me in recognition of the poor customer service I had received. The whole process took 6 months from my original request to switch to Bulb . Had I not involved the Omdudsman I'm sure I would still be trying to communicate with someone at British Gas customer services who actually cared and who was actually authorised to do something.",Yes,30-Mar-21,"Thank you for your review, Martin.

United Kingdom,34,5,04-Mar-21,3,1,2021,A Much Easier Process Than I Expected,"I had been trying to close a Three Mobile Broadband account for months - they said they were unable to close the account 'due to Covid', and when they did agree to close my account, sent me repeated 'final bills' - every time I paid one, they'd send me another 'final bill', assuring me that if I paid this one, it WOULD be the final one (but it wasn't)  I also had debt collectors ask me for an amount that didn't match any bills I'd been sent and for which Three refused to provide a bill or any explanation!  Having gone through Three's complaints process with no result (they did not respond at all), I had no idea where to go next. I was really reluctant to contact the Ombudsman because I thought the process would be too complicated, but it was surprisingly straightforward, and when I did have a problem completing the online form, I called them and a very helpful lady explained what I needed to do.  Within a couple of weeks, Three had refunded my money and closed the account completely. I'm sure if I hadn't gone to Ombudsman Services, they would still be hassling me with more 'final bills'.  It's a wonderful feeling finally getting rid of all that stress and worry.  So if you've exhausted the complaints procedure with a company and not got anywhere, please try Ombudsman Services.  It's really not as difficult as you think it will be.  (Just make sure you keep copies of all letters/emails/notes of phone calls with the company in question, as you will need to provide evidence of your complaint)",Yes,05-Mar-21,"Hi!

They ignored my recorded delivery letter and the many emails sent. In a last attempt to resolve this issue I contacted Ombudsman Energy Service for advice and assistance in September 2020.  Best decision ever!!!!After I had raised a complaint to TE Ombudsman Services took the reins. I fortunately had retained all my emails to TE and Leanne Barber had the arduous task of going through them.

Upon the ombudsman engagement they suddenly became cooperative and the situation was resolved and the settlement I had to pay was reasonable and not the ridiculous amount I was being hassled to pay (this behaviour on the part of the energy suppliers must have serious impact on the mental health of many thousands of customers and has to cease - and the ombudsman is an excellent vehicle to exert this control) .

Prior to her intervention, I was being given the run around by the energy provider in replacing a meter that provided no usage readings. Assurances of arriving on a certain date for installation, closure of complaint's and lack of followup was the norm. The usual excuse of engineers being stretched with their work load, was the reason for Poor service. The energy provider is happy to charge at comparatively expensive market rates. Defeating the conventional wisdom: ""You get what you pay for!"" The utility market was better from a service and rate perspective, when there was active competition & more providers. If only we can get the ""wide area network"" to work! So that the Gas Smart meter readings get submitted automatically. But!

United Kingdom,19,5,13-Jun-23,6,2,2023,Thank Goodness for Ombudsman Services,"Having experienced months of irregular billing and evasive customer service from my dual energy supplier, British Gas, in January 2023, I switched my energy account to Octopus Energy… who incidentally were/are brilliant!Then on one cold February morning, I awoke to find that the good folk at British Gas had withdrew £1995.22 from my bank account, without any prior notice, putting my account overdrawn and given my agreed monthly Direct Debit mandate was for £670.00. Due to this ongoing, absolutely awful lack of customer service, difficult communication and random accounting/billing received from BG and now followed by this extortionate and incorrect withdrawal from my bank account, I decided to contact Ombudsman Services to report their actions, hopeful that I may receive a helping hand to sort everything out. My case handler was Daniel Moore, who was so efficient, attentive, understanding and friendly, albeit absolutely professional in every sense. He assured me that he would do his utmost to investigate this matter thoroughly, arriving at a solution to resolve the matter.As of the 22nd February, I set about uploading as much evidence as possible via the OS website. Once everything was complete and submitted, Daniel contacted me via telephone to confirm everything was addressed in order for him to begin his investigation. Meanwhile, British Gas continued to badger me for an alleged outstanding balance of £1314.10, threatening legal action, debt recovery and potential impact on my existing excellent credit score/rating. I duly forwarded this letter of demand to OS who kindly sent a ‘debt hold request’ to BG, whilst the case was being resolved.On 16th May, I received correspondence from Daniel at OS, informing me that my case had now been fully investigated and concluded. His findings were as follows:   “British Gas had overcharged the energy usage from the period of October 2021, to the cancellation of the account on 23 January 2023. As opposed to the suggested outstanding balance due, then being £1314.10, the account was actually in credit of £327.63, refund of which was to be issued and the account then indefinitely closed. Whilst it is appreciated that the supplier has now re-calculated the account, issuing a refund and closing the account, it should not have taken the supplier over 3 months before completing this and as such, this is a shortfall in service received. Taking into consideration the financial impact this issue has caused, as the supplier has chased for outstanding balances on the account before determining that the account was actually in credit. This would have caused stress and anxiety to the customer when dealing with the matter. This would have also added unnecessary stress regarding a false outstanding balance and finding the funds for this, only to be informed the account was constantly in credit. Due to the poor service received it’s deemed that an apology and £100 goodwill award is reasonable.”Thank goodness for Mr Daniel Moore AND the Ombudsman Service, without which, I would have been paying British Gas over £1640.00 too much for my energy usage, taking into account the £1314+ demanded and the subsequent £327+ credit. Suffice to say, I have now received the £100 compensation award from BG, along with a short, very brief letter of apology so therefore my case with OS is now closed. Please, anyone and everyone who may read this lengthy, yet honest testimonial from someone who has been subjected to the most dreadful experience, do look at the wonderful service that everyone in the UK is privy to, that of the OMBUDSMAN SERVICES. If you need the help, advice or assistance of this fine group of independent professionals, they resolve disputes between consumers and companies, their service is free, impartial and simple to use.

United Kingdom,10,5,21-Mar-23,3,1,2023,SICK OF BEING FOBBED OFF WITH YOUR ENERGY SUPPLIER? CONTACT THE OMBUDSMAN.,"After months of broken promises, phone calls & emails to British Gas I had got nowhere near to any answers or a resolution to my problem. Eventually & reluctantly I contacted the Ombudsman. I say reluctantly because I thought it would be a long winded and complicated process to lodge my complaint, which would take up even more of my time. How wrong I was. The whole process was very easy and was explained to me step by step by my Ombudsman advisor. She would always take my calls and respond to my emails promptly and basically she supported me throughout the process. I raised my complaint on Jan 21st 2023 and a decision was made (in my favour & upholding my complaint) on Feb 16th 2023. I have nothing but praise and gratitude for the Ombudsman service and urge anyone having a problem with their energy provider to contact this wonderful organisation because they get things done.",Yes,22-Mar-23,"Hi Diane, we are happy to hear that our team were there to support you through your dispute.

United Kingdom,3,5,19-Jan-23,1,1,2023,A positive experience....,"Sorry for the long post but I wanted this to be accurate and honest account.  I thought this may be a waste of time but it proved a positive experience for me.  I had an issue with British Gas where my IHD had stopped working and I was unable to see my energy usage.  The app used to show this information so initially I wasn't too bothered but when the app stopped working too I had no way of monitoring my usage.  Having raised this with British Gas and receiving an email saying 'sorry to hear you are not happy etc...you can expect a response within 14 days...'  4 weeks later I received my first communication and it soon became apparent that my emails weren't being answered in full (I'm not convinced they were even being read as I kept getting contradicting answers with each response). I felt it unprofessional to receive answers that had no relevance to the points raised and to be given a deadline to respond by otherwise the complaint would be closed.  I wasn't going to let them close the call as it was not resolved in my eyes, even if it was in theirs.  After 8 weeks I received an email from British Gas who advised I could now raise with the Ombudsman as a resolution had not been received. I did a bit of research as to what to expect from the Ombudsman service and was under no illusion that I may not get anywhere or anything from doing this, but for me it was the principle that consumers complaints are just not taken seriously anymore. I found the portal easy to use.  I was worried that the evidence of emails would be hard to decipher as I had to do a lot of renaming of documents so they were read in order and in some cases had to supply screenshots as British Gas never seemed to respond on the same email trail.  However my caseworker clearly read and made sense of it all and she decided there were two elements to this, the non working IHD and the poor customer service.The outcome:  It was explained to me that as the IHD was over 1 year old British Gas were not in a position to replace it and as this was their company policy the Ombudsman was not able to intervene.  I was offered the chance to purchase a compatible IHD for which I would be reimbursed and was provided details of the device.  I was allowed to do some research of the device and decided against this as a few people mentioned it didn't work too well with British Gas and that would mean any issues would need to be taken up with the third party.  The thought of it not working filled me with dread if I had to start ringing a support line again.  After filing this complaint with the Ombudman I had been made aware of an app called Loop which I signed up to which gives me my usage and works well.  The only thing it doesn't do is give 'my usage now' but I don't have time to sit and monitor that all day anyway, so for me this is adequate.  Anyone reading this who is thinking about signing up for Loop it is worth noting you have to enter Credit Card details, this is purely to provide proof you live at the address.  It is  endorsed by Martin Lewis and has great reviews and i've been using this now since November with no issues.  I declined this IHD explaining the above.  My caseworker came back to me later that day after speaking to British Gas and I was offered £100 and a letter of apology for the poor Customer Service, which I accepted. The money was showing in my account the same day along with a letter.  The letter was a standard one (but I had no expectation of anything different).  As I said earlier it was the principle.Working in an IT support role myself I am very well aware that some companies are only interested in stats, ie calls raised against calls completed, about the number of outstanding calls remaining open after the matrixed resolution date set by the system.  That makes staff only interested in the number of calls they can complete and close making their stats look great.  Whatever happened to great customer service, someone actually wanting to give someone a positive result, to actually help.  There is a lot to be said knowing you have made a difference to someone's day who is thrilled that you've actually listened, understood and made their life easier.  I am very grateful I work for a company that puts quality over quantity. Thank you to the lady at the Ombudsman service who did exactly that.",Yes,20-Jan-23,"Hi Sonia, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your experience of using our service.

I think their complaints process had tied itself in knots.  I warned I would use the service and as there was no progress, I tried it for the first time.  The service was easy to use, however I think you need to invest a bit of time presenting your case at the outset.  It is a person that deals with the information you give and it has to be backed up with evidence.  If you can provide this at the outset, the utility company will find it difficult to provide an argument (in my case they didn't fight it) and things can move quite quickly.In my case, it took about 6 weeks.  The Ombudsman responded within days and was able to make fast and clear decisions.  Most of the time was taken by me providing extra evidence I should have at the outset, the utility company taking a reasonable 2 weeks to respond to the ombudsman and then then for the utility company to implement the decision.  This latter time was slowed by the postal strikes.This is an independent service and I had to be respectful of any decision they made, knowing it may not be in my favour or provide the outcome I would like. As it happened, I thought the outcome was fair and reasonable.  I am not a millionaire as a result, but I got a fair compensation for my troubles.An excellent and easy to use service.

Even if the case hadn't gone my way, I realise that they are not working for the providers and make a judgement based upon what's in front of them.In my case, a BT engineer filed a report that there were no faults to fix on a second visit, but managed to spend an hour not fixing anything. He also said that he'd come to fix faults on my line that had never been reported, or were even an issue. Telecomms providers are apparently unabale to question a BT engineer's report and tried to charge me for the visit. The engineer did fix the fault I had, but confused the appointment with somebody else's. This meant that I was charged £120 for the ""unnecessary"" call-out. Thanks to the Ombudsman Service, the telecomms company are now going to refund the £120.Sometimes people do look at things and take a common-sense approach to a problem. In my case, they realised that I wouldn't call an engineer out a second time, if the fault didn't still exist, knowing full well that I'd have to pay for wasting their time.",Yes,08-Jun-22,"Hi Alan, We are glad to hear that we were able to get you the refund from your communications provider and we are happy that you had a positive resolution to your dispute.

United Kingdom,6,5,19-Jan-22,1,1,2022,Complaint against SSE,"Our complaint was against SSE regarding electric. The situation with them was ongoing for about a year before I referred my case to the Ombudsman. It was then dealt with, in the time schedule and a clear and precise decision was sent via my online account. SSE has still not resolved the issue fully which prompted me to telephone my case administrator Umar, on 17th Jan. 22. He was very helpful & told me to contact the Remedy Team. I did this on 18th, here Kerry took my continued grievance on board and within an hour he had been in touch with SSE and got back to me with their offer of a refund of £310 which is less than we expected as our account has now increased to almost £460 in credit but at least it is most of our money back. They have 7 days to execute this but I won't be convinced until that money is in our account. The total incompetence of the SSE call staff and the way we have been treated by them is an absolute disgrace and I wonder how many other pensioners, who perhaps are not as financially comfortable or technically able as me would have accepted being told that your account is correct (when clearly it was not) and have been conned out of hundreds of pounds.

How is it possible that Octopus is willing to offer a certain compensation, but the Ombudsman refuses? The logic behind this is absurd.3. Both Octopus and I acknowledged that the bill was incorrect and agreed on the correct rate. Yet, the Ombudsman refused to accept this. I spent an hour on the phone explaining why the bill was wrong.4. the case has been taking 2 years, it's absurd that they say they won't compensate based on the time lost. the whole point of the dispute is the lost time, and time is money. 5. Octopus sent someone to my house to read the meter without my permission, and they claim it's was doable...6. What’s even more ridiculous is that when I expressed my dissatisfaction with the outcome, the Ombudsman became defensive, twice emphasizing that they were offering me a free service. When I asked who pays them, they admitted it was the energy company. That made everything clear—whoever pays you, you will naturally be biased towards. Their implication was that since the Ombudsman’s service is free, I should be grateful and accept the result. Really? I’ve been sold out by you and Octopus, and now you expect me to thank you for it?",Yes,24-Sep-24,"Hi Lee, we're sorry that you have not had a positive experience when using our services.

United Kingdom,3,1,11-Sep-24,9,3,2024,Terrible experience,I am not sure what is the purpose of the EO. Scottish power had to install gas meter in my house. After couple of months and several missed appointments from them I have contacted the Energy Ombudsman who made me believe it is the right thing to do. The case was opened on 5th June 2024 and they made the decision that SP have to install gas meter  by 20th August and they have legal responsibilities to do that. Today is 11th September still no gas meter and the EO can't even speak with SP. SP doesn't want to speak to me as the case is with the EO. I have much better communication with SP before engaging with the EO. 5 months without hot water and heating and I have two small children in the house. No indication when the gas meter will be installed.,Yes,12-Sep-24,"Hi Luben,Thanks for leaving a review.I'm really sorry to hear this.

EE are selling a Product that advertises 1.6G broadband, the problem is the equipment EE supply cannot handle those speeds, yes it can take in the speed, but can only distribute 1GB at the output, therefore mis selling the product. If you search and dig into the small print it does say EE only guarantee the speeds to the hub, but what is the point in selling a product that you cant actually access these speeds. The person who was assigned the case never answered the phone, would only communicate via their messaging system, called me back once and told me to leave a message on  their system if i had an issue, would not engage in any form of help / discussion, despite the Ombudsmen  portal saying please contact us via phone for any queries, Pretty poor service form EE and this supposed support systemReceived a response to this review from the Ombudsmen, again Ombudsmen Service still miss the point, EE's supplied hardware is NOT capable of delivering the speeds advertised and the Ombudsmen service are quite happy about it! case closed as far as they are concerned!",Yes,19-Sep-24,"Hello Steve , we're sorry to hear that you have not had a positive experience when using our services.

United Kingdom,1,1,11-Apr-24,4,2,2024,I received a terrible service at this…,"I received a terrible service at this ombudsman. After around 3 months wait (in which I’d presumed my complaint was being investigated) I received a decision that addressed 1/3 of the issues I’d raised with the EO. Spent 2 weeks  (timeframe allowed before its closed) trying to make contact with the caseworker, who consistently failed to return my calls despite my voicemails, emails and messages through colleagues. I spoke with a call handler on the main contact number (seemingly the only helpful team) who passed my concerns on. Decision passed for ‘review’ to another caseworker, who just reiterated original decision and closed case. Spent another 2 weeks attempting to explain there was zero explanation on 2/3 issues that were still outstanding, then eventually received a response on just the one of the outstanding issues, essentially saying that 2+2=7 and British Gas had billed correctly. When I responded using their own explanation to highlight why I’d been double billed, got a response back to say case is closed and you’re free to take other action.

United Kingdom,19,1,26-Feb-24,2,1,2024,Biased in favour of the Energy Supplier,"The first and perhaps most important thing to remember is that the Ombudsman is funded by the energy companies. That inherent conflict of interest is obvious in the bias of the decisions issued which heavily favour the energy company - in this case British Gas - as against favouring protection of the consumer. Perhaps if more people complained both to their energy company for shoddy service and the Ombudsman about their investigation we wouldn't have the well-deserved reputation of ""Rip-Off Britain"".",Yes,27-Feb-24,"Hello, we're sorry that you haven't had a positive experience when using our services. We charge a fee to suppliers for each case that a consumer chooses to bring to us. This fee is charged regardless of the outcome of the case.

Thank you",1
United Kingdom,7,1,06-Feb-24,2,1,2024,"Not fit for purpose, utterly failing consumers","Cases closed at request of energy companies without speaking to the customer they are supposed to represent. Reasons for closure are woefully poor, non-descriptive, lacking in detail & closures made in error, causing excessive frustration and delays.Complaints about their own service unanswered after 3 weeks and no details of their own complaints process anywhere to be found.Numerous phone calls and increased frustration and delays and time wasted trying to resolve this because your case handler couldn't be bothered to communicate as requested and rushed to close a case he clearly failed to take the tme to read and comprehend - EG225414-23.I maintain and have the experience over many complaints that this service is utterly failing consumers with a seemingly very clear bias to energy suppliers, causing as much stress, frustration and issues as the actual energy companies and their standard useless responses to these ratings - ""our team take great care"", ""don't hesitate to contact us"" etc etc do not reflect my experiences over many cases and do nothing to fix their underlying issues of poor customer service levels, failure to communicate and engage with complainees and a failure to take the time to read and fully comprehend the complaints raised.Complaint raised over multiple issues with So Energy, including breach of licence, overbilling, potential lies etc. So Energy queried and I asked the case handler, K P to contact me about this, he didn't bother and closed the case stating 'duplication'. Duplication of what and to what extent is never explained. He even stated I could re-open the case but as he still hasn't explained what he deems the duplication to be, how can I do that? He also has refused all attempts for him to meaningfully engage. I have now refused to spend any more of my limited time trying to engage with such a poor and biased operative. Absolute farce and woefully inept customer service.This is the second of the last 3 cases closed with the non-descrpitive 'duplication' stated as a reason. Neither of these cases actually have any duplication in them, they admitted the first they closed wasn't actually a duplication and was finally resolved after many delays, a useless biased 'coach' and tonnes of frustration. I am still waiting for them to respond after 3 weeks to the complaint I have raised over the latest case closed,Called them today to find out what is happening about a complaint raised against the ombudsman on 16 Jan which had to be e-mailed as their online submission failed multiple times to submit with no error messages (after reading these reviews i am not the only one with this submission failure on their site). After 26 minutes I still have no idea what is happening as the phone line operatives don't have access to check where my complaint about the energy ombudsman is or even if it has been received - farcical!! I have been told the relevant department has now been e-mailed to call me back - hmmm I shall be amazed if this actually happens.If you have any mental health issues do not use this service they will utterly fail you and cause your stress, anxiety, anger and frustration to escalate.For the Energy ombudsman - don't bother responding with your usual cut and paste reply and offering to 'contact you' it's degrading, pointless and you should spend time fixing your obvious training and process issues. You also have the worst online submission and case interface of any ombudsman, try upgrading it from the 1960's to this century.Simply not fit for purpose and haven't been for over 2 years.",Yes,07-Feb-24,"Hello Stephen, we're sorry that you haven't had a positive experience when using our services.

I eventually complained to the ombudsman about this and the ombudsman directed BG to sort the meters out. The ombudman's resolution did not also specify to get the IHD working and of course BG did not get the IHD working. When I said to the ombudsman that the IHD was not working they said I would have to start the complaints procedure again with BG and in 8 weeks time complain again to the ombudsman. Why could the ombudsman not include getting the IHD working as part of the resolution as getting it working is part of the meter commissioning process?

They have not and continaully keep emailing me asking the same question which I have responded to a number of times. I have evidenced this in many emails to both E.on and the Ombudsman. They also said they could not investigate E.on fraudulently taking unauthorised payments from my credit card as the bill had been passed to a debt collection company because E.on had not dealt with the problems in the first place.

United Kingdom,21,1,21-Jun-23,6,2,2023,A failing organisation,"The largest proportion of reviews (47%) are 1-star, so Ombudsman Services are a failing organisation with a pitifully dismal performance.  In my dispute with Sainsbury’s Energy (E.ON) the supplier switched my electricity billing to a dual (day/night) tariff without my agreement and ignored months of requests to stop the overcharge.  The Ombudsman case handler did not pick up on this and failed to address my complaint, despite my appealing her flawed initial decision.  The appeal was not appropriately addressed at all, the same case handler reviewed and endorsed her deeply flawed initial decision.  I would give 0-star for my case handler who did not get to grips with the issue and wasted my time, and did not investigate or resolve the issue (which was obvious and straightforward) properly.",Yes,22-Jun-23,"Hello, we're sorry to hear that you have not had a positive experience when using our services.

It has taken months to go through this.  Ombudsman then inform me that the decision had now been made and complaint was closed.  I submitted evidence to prove it was not closed and the final statement from Ombudsman did NOT have anything to do with the original complaint.  This case had been escalated and it was apparent the case holder had not read any of the history and therefore made a decision based on something that did not have thing to do with the case ( the new case holder had not got a clue). I therefore submitted evidence that it was not closed and I am today 04/05/2023 still in the same position as when I first logged my complaint last year.  Since my last reply/message sent back to Ombudsman I have not received any further answer and my energy company are still holding onto my money!!!!!!!!

The Ombudsman suggested it was in no ones interest to fine Good Energy and punish them as this would ultimately affect the end user (i.e. the customer) with high tariffs etc..  They suggested Good Energy should offer a credit note of £250, write a letter of apology and bill me correctly within 28 days. After 28 days I received one sentence of a standard meagre apology. Not even addressed to me but as the Ombudsman state there are no rules around the integrity of an apology plus I have still not been billed correctly. Good Energy informed the Ombudsman that remedies have been completed even though they haven't. Ombudsman have now closed the case. I wrote to the Ombudsman showing proof of no action taken with regards Remedies and have heard nothing in reply... I can only assume the Ombudsman favour large corporations over general public complaints. Although difficult to explain I actually understand the reasons as to why.

United Kingdom,8,1,07-Mar-23,3,1,2023,Complaint about electric meters…,Complaint about electric meters registering usage when all meters switched off for 21 days. Sent off numerous pieces of evidence including emails from energy company confirming that meters had registered usage - even though meters switched at mains. Had been charged for this electricity. Ombudsman was difficult to get in touch with. One phone call from him when I had left 3 or 4 messages on his answering machine. Although the meters were off - and no electricity used there is (unknown to us and possibly millions of customers) a margin of error - in our case in favour of the energy company. Hence we were charged per day for electricity not used. The ombudsman ruled in favour of the energy company even though they had admitted usage when meters switched off. It’s the ‘norm’.

United Kingdom,7,1,23-Nov-22,11,4,2022,Absolutely terrible service,"Absolutely terrible service. They ignored evidence provided by British Gas that their energy bills were implausible. They accepted, lock stock and barrel, British Gas' recommendations. So even though my complaint was upheld, they allowed British Gas to offer a £100 goodwill payment while hitting me with a £4000 bill. To add insult to injury, they stated in their letter that British Gas had to offer me a payment plan. British Gas didn't, and when I raised this with the Energy Ombudsman they said there was nothing they can do. They are completely in the pockets of energy companies like British Gas, who have teams of people who know what to say to pull the wool over their eyes.PS - The reply below shows how hopeless and disingenuous the Energy Ombudsman are. They didn't take enough care in considering the evidence - because British Gas had admitted, in writing, that their bill was not reliable, but this was ignored (it wasn't even referenced in the decision letter) and I got the £4000 bill anyway. Their 'investigations team', who did everything British Gas told them to do throughout this case, even though my complaint was UPHELD, said that they should offer a payment plan. They didn't, and when I complained about this, their crack 'investigations team' just gave me the phone number for British Gas and shut down the case. When I asked how I could complain about the energy ombudsman's own poor performance, I got emailed a weblink which said I couldn't.

United Kingdom,4,1,23-Nov-22,11,4,2022,My opinion and experience,"Five months ago I started a complaint against SSE, as with many people out there I'm sure being having issues with the enegery price theft!Now going directly with SSE falling onto death ears and they kept changing my bills and blaming the previous supplier I was with (Sparks Energy) they kept rising my bills, I kept to their so called money saving options by sticking with the off peak times. I live in a small two bed flat nothing fancy I work 5 to 6 days a week and mostly late shifts, so I get home from midnight so from midnight to 0500 that's Off-peak! Anyway. When I was recommended to go to Ombudsman that they could help clear this mess up I agreed, so I did started a case back in June, then after 4 and a bit months they came to a conclusion of a settlement bill and like sse stated that the fault was on Sparks side, even though it wasn't mine but because of being a customer I should of been checking regularly on my accounts!So they said that they Got SSE to adjust some of the bill previously from Sparks Energy and an apology letter with £60 voucher of GOOD WILL GESTURE lol but none of that came to be, and SSE appealed the first draft, so I waited for another month to only come back with a new draft and SSE appeal for an extra £20 that Ombudsman missed out on LOL, so when I replied back to Ombudsman Investigating officer he mentioned that this new draft agreement was still in my favour, so I was made to believe!Well very long stressful, aggravating almost 6 months of it all I'm £100 worse off then before I went through with Ombudsman, I know I've been told that they do get paid off by the enegery companies maybe that's their way for getting the commission I don't know all I can say is that from my experience I can say that there was a real investigation as I never saw anything being done just updated messages back and forth to having to agreed to except the deal or not.I can tell you this if I was one of the elites this wouldn't happen I would easily walk away with paying a penny!!Personally at this point I won't be recommended Ombudsman, I haven't met anyone that has used them beore or even heard of them. But this is my opinion and experience! I don't always go by what the 5 star reviews say because like with many businesses it's easy manipulated, having staff members, friends and family to go online and give top reviews so it looks good!And this was pointed out to me by an old friend who's a entrepreneur investor.",Yes,24-Nov-22,"Hello, thank you for taking the time to share your experience when using our services, we are sorry to hear that you have not had a positive experience.

United Kingdom,29,1,19-May-22,5,2,2022,Sadly of no help,"I needed help to resolve longstanding  issues with my energy company over billing and IT issues and poor communication and customer service. I had received  a deadlock letter and my supplier pointed me to the Ombudsman at the same time withdrawing  all the agreements  I had already negotiated  with them as they said the Ombudsman  would have to rule on resolutions.Initially  it looked promising.  The initial call handlers were very helpful and approachable. The first investigation  was thorough and the Investgating  officer spent time taking details from me and checking things out. He provided  a detailed report which outlined deficiencies in customer  service. He found my billing to be correct.  He recommended  all the things that I had already negotiated  myself. I was doubtful but was on the point of paying substantial alledged arrears when a further error occurred  and in fixing that historical  errors were found by my supplier and reversed.Problems over billing continued and my case was clearly  unresolved . I went back to the Ombudsman.  Again the initial call handler was brilliant  and promised a call back from the Investigation  Officer. This never came. Further promises of contact also never materialised.When I persisted a further investigation  was carried out this time by a different officer. This time there was no discussion  with me and she accepted  the suppliers word that all was now sorted without checking with me if that was correct and closed my case as resolved.It took a further 10 months for me to get things sorted without any help. Requests  for further help were just not replied to. Evidence I supplied of continued  problems was not acted on. And when even my energy supplier  themselves were acknowledging  mistakes and ""overbilling"" and an IT issue which meant my direct debit was being set to 10x my usage the investigation  officer stood by her findings that I had been underbilled and that my case was resolved. I involved CAB. They said I had a case but couldn't  act for me as in their opinion I had an unresolved  case that was still with the Ombudsman and therefore I should go back to them. When I did so there was just no response.Ombudsman  Services do have their own complaints  process. You fill in a form  that you are unhappy  with the service.  In my case that resulted in no response.  When I chased them I received  a letter from the Investigation  Officer I was unhappy with basically repeating her opinion that I had been correctly billed and my issue resolved .She also told me that a meter accuracy test had found my meter was recording  accurately.  My supplier however had told me it was faulty, actually  clocking slow and they had replaced it .Even my energy supplier  acknowledges that I was not billed correctly  and that problems on my account  have not been resolved.  Based on this experience  if I have similar problems in the future I will go to CAB and hope that this good service staffed primarily by volunteers  is not too overloaded with energy complaints to helpUpdate.Thank you for your reply. My apologies  for the confusion over your first response to my complaint.  You did indeed send me an email explaining  the complaints  process that would be followed. There was however no further  response within the time frame given. I followed  up when a further 3 weeks had passed beyond that time frame .The rest of my review reflects my experience and the letter I received  from the Investigation  Officer contained nothing that helped resolve the situation.",Yes,20-May-22,"Hi Megan, thank you for taking the time to write your review.

United Kingdom,18,1,19-Apr-22,4,2,2022,Neither fair nor unbiased,"I had a dispute with EE over their deceitful contracts and the way they breach them by enticing you in a 2 year contract and changing terms and conditions to disadvantage you. They then make it impossible for you to end the contract and increase the price of your package whilst asking you to pay additionally for roaming charges. Before entering into contract they do not provide a link or a pop up window where you can see their terms and conditions so once you opt in, they can then put the price up, not give you free roaming and data allowance that was part of your contact and don’t wang to let you change or end contract without a hefty fee. You then invest a lot of time and effort to complain, then write to Ombudsman service spending days, if not weeks uploading evidence and trying to exercise your basic consumer rights while fighting these unfair contract terms and along the way you encounter a kind Mr Barry Kinnard who gives you a call to verify a few things and he tells you he will review the case just now and in case you need him to clarify anything he will be away the next week, but can catch up with you the following week. You have a nice chat and you explain to Mr Barry how you entered into that contract opting to have a lot of mobile data you normally spend abroad, but now don’t need it as EE has now decided to put their prices up and take away the privilege of you using your mobile data in EU 5 months into the contract and you found this out from an e-mail they send you in March informing you of these changes effective from April. They also tell you you can’t downgrade and if you want to exit the contract they have breached you need to pay them out in full for the next 18 months. Mr Barry must have known he was going to decide the case in EE’s favour or he wouldn’t have told me when he will be back in case I need him to clarify his decision. Very reassuring to know he knew the outcome before even going over the case. And sure enough I did not make a single valid point and everything was nice and fair when he reviewed the changed and updated terms and conditions which now did include the change in roaming, but would not have been the same terms and conditions available at the very bottom of EE’s website along many other generic terms and conditions dealing with all sorts of different services and not available to you before entering into a contract online and prior to becoming entrapped in a contract thats is unfair, biased and illegal.

They ignored this, they basically said that the energy company said that as I don’t pay via direct debit (it doesn’t work for me with how my wages are paid) that I had slipped the net and that I should think about setting up direct debit to avoid this in future!! I pay by weekly standing order. They couldn’t find anything wrong and offered zero explanation as to why the company have not been billing me for gas usage. They basically said the energy company had failed in their customer service and that they should resolve this and send me a written apology and give me £100 for my “inconvenience” the energy company did this, finally billed me slapping £500 on to my account, then sent me a written apology where the bottom line was we now need you to set up a payment plan (I already pay weekly) by the 16th this month or they will commence legal proceedings. Not exactly an apology is it when they failed to bill me for months and I was trying to draw attention to that. Then guess what. Following that apology and finally billing me up to date, this months bill comes and once again it’s minus the gas on it. So they haven’t learnt a damn thing and the ombudsman have basically allowed them to get off with a measly £100 a fake apology and a threat and now they are back to their old tricks. How do I increase my payments when I have zero idea what my correct monthly usage is because they aren’t billing me? This has been my argument but nope this was dismissed. When the ombudsman ruled it was basically take £100 and a fake apology case closed or don’t take that and case will be closed anyway. So I took the £100 because it’s the very least they could do and I am now seeking legal advice with the law centre and going to my local MP do expose both the energy company and the ombudsman for severe failings. My advice don’t bother with them as they aren’t there for the customer and will never rule In your favour causing further hardship and anger as you continue to fight to get things resolved.",Yes,06-Apr-22,"Hi Melanie, We are sorry that you have not had a positive experience when using our service.

Off to Twitter to publicise the issue and Plusnet eventually offer the £60 and release of the contracts which I was happy to accept.A couple of months later Plusnet are still sending emails for bills but couldn't log on as I had no account and phoning Plusnet they said it was just a system error. I then applied for credit card that came with £100 Amazon voucher for acceptance only to find I was refused this, checking my credit score I discover that the Plusnet bill remained unpaid and I have lost 100 point on my credit score.Back to Plusnet and Ombudsman Services and still no understanding of the impact on my life and effort put into sorting this out.

United Kingdom,4,1,19-Jan-22,1,1,2022,Complained to BT as my late father had…,"Complained to BT as my late father had been charged for broadband that had never been installed. Only discovered when I was going through his financial records and checked his BT bills. BT rejected my complaint as their records only went back for 6 months, my father had written on a BT letter 'Broadband cancelled 23/1/18', and all his subsequent bills all mentioned broadband. BT had, however, offered a refund of 9 months broadband costs as a goodwill gesture. I declined this as this my father had paid for this service for nearly 4 years. Then approached the Ombudsman Service and provided a copy of BT letter, dated 23/1/18, telling my father how to return a BT Smart Hub (with a specific serial number) if he had not already done so. Even this astonishing coincidence of dates was just that, not conclusive that the hub had, in fact, been returned. My suggestion that they ask BT for the current location of this hub, as they had provided the serial number, was ignored though, to me, seemed to be the easiest way of confirming one way or the other that this hub had never been installed at my late fathers' address. The OS appeared to accept the BT responses throughout and attached very little weight to the mass of documents I supplied. Struck me as a half-hearted investigation at best, doing just enough to get off their desk, rather than conducting a thorough review.

United Kingdom,5,1,11-Jan-22,1,1,2022,"Waste of time, They don't work or care about you.","First don't waste your time with the Ombudsman Services. The double Standards are evident and they don't care about you. This service just exists to make you believe that you live in a ""Democracy"" and fair world, but in reality, they don't care about your problem. Since the beginning of my contract 03/2014 with BG was not possible to identify the Gas meter that supplied the flat, as a result, incorrect bills were generated and 05/2015 I have raised my first complain. In 09/2015 during the annual boiler inspection, performed by a BG’s engineer, the correct meter was identified and information sent to BG. In the next 2 years (yes 2 years) 2 years, BG constantly requested the same information, again and again. When lawfully questioning the values of the bills issued to me BG reported missing payments affecting my credit record.  Worth mention that I have raised more than 10 enquiries and the correct gas meter was identified by a BG Engineer 2 years before. After paying a settlement to keep my sanity BG continue issue wrong bills, lawfully questioning the values of the bills issued to me, and once again all missing payments reported and affecting my credit record. Final bills issued in July 2019 with the note “we estimated your final meter reading”. I have raised a complaint with Ombudsman Services, with more than 100 evidence. BG just provide “account notes” which have been produced unilaterally. For the Investigation Officers, Kirsty Miranda and Keon Glasgow the BG “account notes” are go enough to make a decision. For the Investigation Officers, is reasonable for a supplier to close a complain even if the timeframe for the customer’s response is within 2 weeks during the Christmas break, while they had been ignoring their customers’ enquiries for more than 2 years. It is also acceptable that a customer must raise more than 10 enquires with the supplier to get a response from them. The officers believes as acceptable that even when a resolution for the issue with the gas meter was provided by the supplier’s engineer, BG keep requesting the same information and acceptable that BG took 2 years to show some willingness in resolving my issue. It is also accepted that BG shared information with credit companies even when I was lawfully pursuing my rights of discussing incorrect billings. For the officers is acceptable that during the period while I was lawfully discussing the bills, I was harassed and intimidated by external companies and ignore my efforts to reach a solution with BG. For the officers and BG is completely acceptable final bills with estimated readings and assumed correct after I provide evidence showing that the bills are wrong. By reading the decision, one can understand that I should be blamed about the situation just because I was lawfully questioning a bill that was wrong, and that I should bury my head in the sand and accept my faith!Not to mention that the marks on the credit score don't match with any bill issued and the dates on the records are also wrong. For the officers and BG is acceptable to make a request to Medway Magistrate Court to grant their entry in the property to change the meter. After BG’s legal representative decided not to move forward with the hearing after seeing all the evidence that I had with me at the time, most likely because they were clearly showing that BG’s pledges to the court would not be sustained.  But all in good faith and honesty, best public interest and to protect the people against major bullies, the Ombudsman officers say that BG is correct.   We are now in 2022, 7 years after my complain.Don't waste your time here, just go directly to court.Update:Why Ombudsman bother to reply. First the answer is just a copy and paste and they just do it because it looks good in the reviews and shows the indifference about the cases presented, If there is nothing more than can do. The Ombudsman don't think people have better things to do than complain about the incompetence and lack of professionalism of those who, due to their work obligation, should look at all the evidence instead of accepting lies, be fair for both parts and stop using double standards!!",Yes,12-Jan-22,"Hello Pedro, We are sorry that you have had a dissapointing experience when using our services.

Our understanding was the EO was there to work on behalf of the customer but our take on it is that is not fully the case. We had an email saying the issue was closed to which we replied - 'I have to say this is getting ridiculous. Please NOTE the following:- 1)	Yes, we did accept the initial decision as you stated as we did not want to let Scottish Power get away with their dire customer service. However,  on the same or next day the decision came through,  I sent a lengthy complaint to your customer service team (OE) saying the decision TOTALLY ignored other key failings.2)	This led to a post decision appeal which was reviewed by a senior EO investigator, his decision being sent to us on October 26th.3)	This further supported our complaint as he upheld further failings in Scottish Powers customer service and awarded further compensation but again did fail to pick up on a final one.We were  told that if we wish to accept this changed decision we must do it by November 2nd4)	As in (1), we again accepted the decision, this on November 2nd,  as again we did not want Scottish Power to get away with their dire customer service. However, we did point out that despite the senior investigator saying that the one item missed was not clear in the evidence i.e. a fourth meter fitting failure, the evidence chain clearly demonstrated it. He did not acknowledge that was correct. Again, given this we sent another complaint to the OE customer service team saying that although accepting the decision , you the Energy Ombudsman have failed to fully take the complaint against Scottish Power on board again.5)	I have been informed that a response to that complaint might take until the end of the year.For a service that is supposed to be on the side of the consumer, the overall effort in this case has been poor.'You would have thought that given a senior investigator had found further failing that they would have been acted upon for which we would have thought that we would have received confirmation that the decisions taken would be acted on.

Scottish Power has the Ombudsman dangling on their little finger, and they know they have no power to make them do anything, they are just laughing at them.  What a waste of time!, Scottish Power just charge what they want and get away with it. It needs somebody with power in the government to sort Scottish Power out, and take them down.

United Kingdom,6,1,04-Aug-21,8,3,2021,Clearly biased and a waste of time...,"This is the response I gave to Ombudsman Services when asked to rate their services (I gave them a rating of 1);I cannot really fault the actual process - the instructions were clear, there were quick responses to my questions and queries about the process and the process from the start to receiving a decision was quick (although on reflection this may not have been a good thing).However, aside from the process before the decision, the decision itself (not upheld) was a shock and quite frankly (despite claiming the opposite) I do not believe that Ombudsman Services are unbiased or independent!I spent a long time putting together my side of the case. I saught advice from a friend who works in finance and is familiar with cases like mine.The case I prepared put forward my side of the issue eloquently and I had many valid points and evidence that supported my case.I was expecting the ombudsman to contact me at least once for further information and to clarify some of my points between receiving the information I provided them and making their decision. The fact that this did not happen leads me to believe that the decision was already made by the ombudsman and again supports my belief that Ombudsman Services' claim to be independent is false and their loyalties clearly remain with the company/supplier and are not invested in the interests of the appellant.I had in fact, consulted o2 forums before I started with the process and discovered there that Ombudsman Services are in fact biased and would be likely to side with o2. Despite this I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt and to go ahead with my case, because getting the money (almost £3000) back that o2 have unjustly taken from me was so important to me. I was shocked by the ombudsman's decision to side with o2 and their decision has impacted my mental health as well as my finances!The final response from the ombudsman was poorly written (factual and grammatical errors), didn't address many of the points or questions I raised and it felt like they hadn't really looked at my case at all. In the same way that they had not contacted me to clarify points or ask for further information before making their decission, it appears that the ombudsman also did not ask o2 for this either and some of the questions and queries I put forward remain unanswered, even now. It appears that these questions will never be addressed! This again, leads me to believe that their intention was to side with O2 the whole time.Finally, I didn't like the options given to me once the final decision was made. I did not accept the ombudsman's decision, but had no further information or evidence to seek an appeal. I could have selected to ""disagree' with the decision, but the outcome of this still amounted to me effectively stating that I ""agreed"" with their decision. My only other option was to accept their decision, but I didn't agree with or wish to accept their decision either and this again left me with the option to state that I ""agreed"" with their decision. I was not going to be forced to accept a decision that I thoroughly disagreed with so I decided to skip this part of the process, although I believe that in doing so it would ultimately state that I accepted the decision.I think that there needs to be some other option for appellants in my situation who do not accept the decision of the ombudsman as essentially the process has the appellant over a barrel in terms of agreeing with the decision when they don't and this is yet another aspect of the process which is unfair.  I know that Ombudsman Services will refute my claims of any bias or siding with o2/companies but as I have discussed above, to me it is very clear that you can go through this process with a strong case, but come away with a biased and unfair decision and unanswered questions!I note that your Trustpilot reviews are also poor with many also believing you are not unbiased. I agree with one review which states that ""The primary concern of the ombudsman appears to be to keep the big company happy rather than helping the consumer."" And like many of the reveiws, I also believe that this has essentially been a waste of my time.To save others the stress and upset this whole process has put me through, I will also be placing this review on Trustpilot. I am sure that I will get a generic response from Ombudsman Services claiming to be unbiased but this will be pointless as the 64% ""Bad"" rating speaks volumes about what to expect from your service.",Yes,05-Aug-21,"Hi Jen, We are sorry to hear of the impact this complaint has had on your finances and mental health. We appreciate the time and effort our consumers put in when raising a complaint with us, this doesn't go unnoticed by our team and really helps our investigation officers to understand the situation at hand.

United Kingdom,2,1,19-Jul-21,7,3,2021,I see the response is 65% bad,"I see the response is 65% bad. I wish I’d read this before entering a process I expected to be reliable and fair.Firstly it takes quite a long time. I started the process back in April and it’s complied with (according to the Ombudsman’s agent) last Thursday (July 15). The ‘resolution’ was an apology (of which I have had plenty from Bulb - they make no difference), fixing of the accounting issues (I’d spent dozens of hours pointing out the issue since joining 3 years ago), installing new meters (who hasn’t been pestered to have smart meters fitting anyway?) plus £150 ‘goodwill’ payment and the amount I’m still in credit. Bulb had offered £80.The ‘implementation’ was an email promising these things literally minutes before the close of office hours on the deadline day. That almost certainly because I’d been stupid enough to call the Ombudsman that day and she clearly tipped off the company presumably to avoid the extra work of escalating the dispute. This is not implemented and in spite of phoning and the statutory message that calls will be returned within 24 hours this has not happened and the dispute has been closed.I would with hindsight have pursued the matter through civil action (small claims). I had a mountain of evidence submitted - it’s a legal obligation for providers to send all records on formal request. Bulb didn’t fulfil that entirely, but there was more than enough to show a very painful, protracted and frustrating correspondence, that ultimately got me nowhere. I’ve spent a good few more hours communicating with the Ombudsman’s service. What has that got me? The satisfaction that Bulb have been penalised by a further £70 for a colossal catalogue of incompetence, neglect and plain lousy service, causing huge stress and frustration, which seems otherwise they will carry on getting away with.

Unfortunately, the nature of our business does mean that there will be one party who doesn't get a decision in their favour and this can be frustrating for consumers who may be in that position, we have to consider both parties information in order to remain fair and impartial and to understand whether the supplier has acted in line with regulations and that the consumer hasn't experienced any detrimental impact.

United Kingdom,26,1,28-Jun-21,6,2,2021,Complete waste of time and energy,"What an absolute waste of time and energy. I actually can't stand this crowd even more than the company I was complaining about. Oh wait, could they actually be the same company because it definitely seemed like it. My complaint was against Shell Energy who, back in 2017 said that I owed them £9,707! My first 4 bills were under £200 per month then the next one was for £9,707!! The previous owner had bills for less than £200 per month too. I leased the place (fully furnished) and have been using the same equipment and heating system etc but instead of under £200 per month, my bills shot up to £700 per month!!!!!Shell eventually sent an independent Siemens engineer to check my meter, he found my first meter faulty by 40%, months later after extremely high bills the same engineer came to check the 2nd meter and found it fast by 20% but Shell wouldn't change the 2nd one saying they didn't believe the engineers findings were correct! The Ombudsman thinks that maybe I was given 'misleading information' from Shell!!!!! Errmhh duh! That was the whole point of me contacting the Ombudsman - to get to the bottom of the 'misleading information'!!!!! Useless, clueless waste of time and energy!The Senior Investigating Officer from Ombudsman Service made the following recommendation : Shell Energy should pay me £100 and give me a written apology for my problems and for Shell's bad customer service! Now that has to be a contradiction in terms for sure!!! What a bunch of morons! Obviously I have declined this and find it extremely insulting. Can anyone out there please tell me how to complain about the Ombudsman Service. They need investigated. They actually really do. I had amazing evidence for my case and they shot me down so completely by bamboozling me with Wattage, meter readings, dates and numbers (one part of this Senior Investigating Officers report showed a meter reading  from Shell Energy from 2019 when in fact it was from 2018 - I argued this and was told he had the evidence from Shell! But I actually proved this was false evidence and the reading was from 2018 ) The Senior Investigating Officer also told me he had checked online and my cottage was on some holiday cottage online letting service! It had the same name as my house but it was in a different area altogether! He then proceeded to tell me I had storage heaters and this was probably why my bills were so expensive!! I told him my house isn't on any online cottage letting service and I don't have storage heaters and his answer was - 'it doesn't make any difference to my case or my decision anyway!! Why put it in your report then Mr Senior Investigating Officer for  Ombudsman Service????Ombudsman Service has got to be THE BIGGEST WASTE OF MONEY - it might be free for the consumer but have you seen what they earn? Huge salaries for doing nothing apart from line the pockets of these large energy suppliers!! They are in it to make money for the supplier. Shell Energy are saying I owe £10,000 and I don't. I know it and the Senior Investigating Officer for Ombudsman Service definitely knows it too but is relentless in his mission to aid the supplier!!!!!!I'm actually disgusted with the lack of investigation into my case and the Senior Investigating Officer stubbornly ignored my evidence. I asked him 'how do I to make a complaint against Ombudsman Service' and he told me that 'I couldn't as he was the top guy and there was no-one above him'!!!!!And  - Senior Investigating Officer for Ombudsman - don't bother with your generic robotic reply. This review is not for you - it's for the consumer. What I want to say to you would not be allowed in print for public reading!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You (Ombudsman Service) have got to be in the running to claim 'Least Helpful Organisation'To your reply (see below) this is my reply to your patronizing reply Mr Senior Investigating Officer for Ombudsman Service :How very patronizing of you! To say you did everything to support me! You point blank refused to investigate my evidence and put falsities in your report!

United Kingdom,1,1,28-Jun-21,6,2,2021,Not a Credible Ombudsman Service,"Closed a complaint without my permission. In the interim Scottish Power found in my favour internally - albeit the apology was woefully inadequate and the resolution non existent. Ombudsman Services Ltd are a private company and are clearly not operating with the intent of improving the performance of the energy suppliers and certainly not protecting the public against fraudulent practices. Instead they are little more than an extension of the energy suppliers customer contempt process - their staff openly admit they are ex-contact centre workers. Time for the Govt to take the ombudsman service in house and sort out this mess.Updated information - Ombudsman Services have since found against themselves and awarded compensation. They are not an effective ombudsman service. Despite finding in my favour and telling Scotting Power what they have to do to resolve the situation, Scottish Power have ignored the instructions from Ombudsman Service. We need a proper Government body. The energy companies are out of control.",Yes,29-Jun-21,"Hi John, We are sorry to hear about the problems you have had raising a complaint with us. We have to adhere to the terms of reference set out by OFGEM, this incudes allowing  the supplier 8 weeks to resolve the complaint using their own complaints procedure before we get involved or if there is a deadlock situation, the supplier will contact you to refer you to use our services before the 8 weeks. If the complaint doesn't meet this criteria then it may be closed automatically or we may ask you for further evidence that demonstrates the date that you first complained to the provider and were issued with a complaint number. Ombudsman services is a non for profit organisation who's role is to impartially resolve complaints between consumers and providers that are signed up with us, whilst we will always provide as much support to our consumers as possible, we aren't on anyone's side and all our decisions are issued based on information provided by both parties.

United Kingdom,10,1,28-Jun-21,6,2,2021,Complete Morons..who dont give a damn!,"I contacted Ombudsman Services regarding an issue with Post Office Telecom, that I had back in March 2019.I consistently had speed issues with them from day 1, and after several calls to them it wasn't resolved, So I decided to leave. Their promise at the time was Being free to leave if we can't fix the pronlem without Charge.I heard nothing further till Jan 2021, when I received letters from BW Legal saying I owed PO Telecom £346.I contacted them, but they had deleted all the account information, So I decided to inform The Ombudsman.Bad Move!Post Office obviously denied everything etc.. but to put a long story short, the Investigating Officer who, upheld the complaint, on the grounds of lack of evidence, but the big factor is... PO told the Ombudsman I signed a contract in Jan 2019, but I didn't even move into My property unti! March 2019... Big! standout factor right there, and anyone with an ounce of common sense would spot that, and question it.Not exactly, The investigating officer finds this appropriate!..somehow, as such I find the fact this person's qualifications of such a position with The Ombudsman itself, questionable!Based on the notes available to me, Post Office said it recorded an order having been created on 11 January 2019 for Account 81739416. This may have been when the request for services was first initiated and may not necessarily been the date services went live. Due to the time that has passed, I have not been provided with any information as to the live date because this has been deleted. Who in their right minds contacts a Broadband Company, and requests a connection months before they move in? Considering I hadn't even seen the property, and views it a Month and half later..what if I decided not to take the property after viewing it? And decided I didn't want it? Even though I had already signed for a Broadband contract for it...This is absolutely ridiculous to suggest!!It's clearly obvious Ombudsman have no intention to do anything, based on PO not being Ofcom registered. A simple explanation of this would have saved a whole lot of time wasted.. but Ombudsman don't bother to tell you thatOne final thing, The Ombudsman say PO contacted me by email, My email starts with georg.green but PO sent it to george.green, the Ombudsman have the correct email, but fail to spot this error on PO's  records, so if they did email me, obviously I never received it., Your an incompetent waste of Oxygen, and I have no hesitation in contacting The Ombudsman Complaints, recommending your dismissal.In light of this, he recommends PO issue me £30 compensation... And you know what you can do with that!My Opinion on these Scum, is Ombudsman Services are a pathetic inbred low life organization, Who should be burried deep in Hell..

United Kingdom,3,1,03-Jun-21,6,2,2021,How I Was Let Down By Ombudsman Services,"As a victim of BT's gross incompetence & intransigence, I did not expect to be victimised a second time by the OSL (Ombudsman Services Ltd)On 3 February I contacted BT to apply for BT Basic. Weeks and months went by & I never received the Application Form despite umpteen phone calls to BT lasting over 5 hours! It wasn't until 22 April that my application was approved. As a result I was overcharged on line rental of £32.59 over a period of 65 days. BT refused to compensate me for the woeful delays but as soon as I took my complaint to the OSL, they offered me £50 compensation. Then came the OSL Decision awarding me £60 compensation (a paltry £10 more than BT's offer) but with a baffling refusal to backdate the line rental to the start of the service on 16 February. This effectively cut my compensation by more than half!! I won on appeal but the second Decision was equally perverse - I was awarded £1.63 against an overcharge on line rental of £32.59. I complained about the obvious error in the calculation but was told the Decision is Final?!?! For me both decisions demonstrated ineptitude and lack of impartiality on the part of OSL’s Investigation Officers. The first decision effectively encouraged wrongdoing by BT since the longer the service delay is, the more it gets away with overcharging! The claim that this was in line with BT’s standard terms was complete hogwash since my BT Basic application has separate terms & conditions. If the OSL can get wrong what is so fundamental, how fit and proper are its officers to provide the Ombudsman service? The second decision showed a lack of basic numeracy for someone given a task as important as one of presiding over an Ombudsman Services appeal, yet when I confronted her about the error in her calculation, I was brushed aside with some pathetic, flawed reasoning over a totally unrelated credit I had received from BT (due to another overcharge on line connection which I was compensated for & not even part of my complaint). For an officer of the OSL to insist the overcharged line rental was £1.61 instead of £32.59 against the facts which were plain as day, is to abuse not only her position as well as the due process but the trust & respect anyone can have for the integrity of the ombudsman service, thus bringing the whole process into disrepute.I have lodged a complaint about poor customer service with OSL. No doubt BT deserves a BBC Panorama-style investigation into the disgusting way it handles BT Basic applications (DID IT DELIBERATELY TRY TO DENY CUSTOMERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPLY FOR BT BASIC???) and it would not be amiss to examine the role of the Ombudsman Services at the same time.",Yes,04-Jun-21,"Hello, We are sorry to hear that you didn't have the best experience when using our services.

United Kingdom,1,1,18-May-21,5,2,2021,A pointless organisation with absolutely no power or care. Look at the number of 1 star reviews!,"The fact that the energy ombudsman have a truly shocking 68% of their customers rating them as 'Bad' on here tells us everything we need to know really. An absolutely pointless organisation with no teeth, no authority and even less concern for the people they are supposed to be fighting for.We rent properties to vulnerable tenants and one of these properties had the incorrect meter installed by scottish power last November meaning that the tenants had/have no way of knowing how much electricity they are using. We were assured by scottish power that our case would be treated as a priority and they would return to fit the correct meter as soon as possible. Needless to say, this didn't happen so we thought it might help to involve the ombudsman, it hasn't.If you believe asking the ombudsman to intervene when you have an issue with one of the power companies will help, please think again. They actually have very little power or authority and scottish power have simply laughed at, and ignored, any and every deadline given. The energy companies know that there's very little the ombudsman can do about it so they pay them no attention and ignore their recommendations time and time again.We have been messed around appallingly by scottish power for nearly seven months now and have  incurred hundreds & hundreds of pounds of costs in lost rents etc and the ombudsman's response? A £100 penalty and yet another extension to the most recent deadlines scottish power have missed (10th of May, 17th of May and, most recently, the 1st of June which I'm certain they will also miss). Seven months to have a meter that was incorrectly installed replaced is ridiculous but the ombudsman simply don't care and seem to think this is fine, even when vulnerable tenants are involved.Complaining to the ombudsman about their own lack of customer service won't get you anywhere either as they will simply fob you off with a standard template email. As I say, they are an entirely toothless, pointless organisation that will always side with the energy companies so please don't waste your time contacting them and just continue to deal with the energy companies directly as the ombudsman will not help in any way and any recommendations or deadlines they issue are routinely ignored anyway with absolutely no penalties for the companies involved.

They did warn me that the office claims to be neutral, but in fact they are there practically to protect large corporations against the consumer. This was not the case in the past, but it is increasingly so, as long as an elected government is controlled indirectly by them.The worse thing of using the ombudsman is that the consumer can not complain against their tactics, wrong doing, corruption, bad practices and so on.Neither can the consumer complain against their officers who lack the necessary skills / experience /training or use the legal system and courts to sue their corrupt officers.The other bad thing of using ombudsman services is losing the option to take your case to the courts and use the legal system to get justice. This is because the large corporation will be vindicated by and armed with the ombudsman’ decision.I wonder who is making money from this establishment?Why it is above the law?Has its work been audited regularly?How much an officer is paid and how recruited?There are so many unanswered questions and complete lack of transparency involving this organisation.",Yes,21-Apr-21,"Hello, Thank you for taking the time to leave us your review and allowing us the opportunity to answer some of your questions/concerns.

They ought to be regulated by government or by parliament. They must have a significant degree of independence from the organisations they are investigating.Ombudsman-services meets none of these requirements.I would therefore strongly advise against using them.They are not an Ombudsman, simply an organization which misleadingly uses the word ombudsman in their title.They ignore the law.They are completely partial.They wasted my time.In my case, they agreed that I met all the legal requirements under the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013 (SI 2013/3134) to cancel my contract with the mobile phone company Three.They then farcically conjured up Three’s Clause 10.1.a (which itself breaches the Consumer Contracts Regulations), requiring me to phone Three Customer Services to arrange Disconnection, notwithstanding their own statement that all Three services were severely impacted by Covid-19 and that consumers experienced difficulties contacting companies during this time. In my case I tried to contact Three on over 20 occasions, at different times of day, using various phone numbers, all with no reply.

They need to be closed down and a government funded independent organisation needs to be put in their place. please start a campaign someone and help the people.  just a cursory search online show the 100s of 1000s of complaints people have against the ombudsman services.  they need to be closed down.i have just read through their copy and pasted responses with slight changes.  i will no doubt get one of my own.   please can someone tell me how i can respond to their automated slightly changed response and also where i can complain about the ombudsman services other than to the ombudsman services themselves?I BET, WITHIN A DAY OF POSTING THIS, THERE WILL BE A FEW FAKE 5 STAR AND A 4 STAR REVIEW OR TWO POSTED TO BRING THEIR SCORES BACK UP.   i am also investigating the way you do this and will post the details of the people and company you use for fake reviews in due course. notice how most of the fake 5 star/4 star reviews will not have a company name.response to ombudsman services 24/02/2021:firstly i await the day someone starts a petition for a government funded regulated ombudsman and not someone paid by the companies.  there is no need for your super biased decisions the people who pay your wages and put a roof over your heads.because the FACT is that without the payment from the utility companies, you would cease to exist, and if you kept deciding against them then they would not use you.  they are under no obligation to do so are they?you BELIEVE i may have been misinformed but we all know the truth of what i am saying.  i have requested copies of memos, emails etc that the employee is said to have. once i am in possession of them i will send them to you.  then you can tell me how misinformed i was.All of the teams at Ombudsman Services take the handling of complaints very seriously and look to provide fair solutions for both parties involved.

United Kingdom,2,1,24-Jan-21,1,1,2021,Not fit for purpose,"I would advise customers not to use the Energy Ombudsman. I made a complaint that an energy supplier had not followed ICO guidance and they had wrongly billed.  When the investigator from the Ombudsman first responded they based their decision on information that was factually incorrect and had no knowledge of the ICO guidelines. When I appealed, they promised another investigator would look at the case.  However, I then waited several months only for the new investigator to disappear and for the first investigator to respond to say he agreed with his own findings.  I have since contacted the ICO who say the energy company acted incorrectly.  Furthermore, I was helped in my application to the Ombudsman by a colleague whose name and email was attached to the complaint. The energy company then out of the blue asked her for money for a closed account before agreeing they shouldn't have and backed down.  The whole experience was clearly very corrupt.  I've seen on Trust Pilot that the Ombudsman say they are not biased but when you go through months of stress only for them to not properly read evidence or understand the law, the whole service feels like a sham. This ombudsman in my opinion is not fit for purpose and my experience revealed to me how clearly it is run to benefit the energy companies and how it is biased against the consumer.",Yes,25-Jan-21,I'm sorry to hear you haven't had the best experience when using our service.

Nobody in my area had any problem and it turned out one of their engineers had wrongly disconnected my line from the 'street cabinet'.

A letter of apology from EON and £30 compensation.While this whole issue was going on EON were using their collection agencies to harass send email, messages to my mobile and letters. The Ombudsman stated they are entitled to do this even though you have a complaint registered with them.This is why these Utility companies carry on their draconian and atrocious service when you have an issue.Avoid EON and it’s about time the Ombudsman be more accountable and punish these large companies when they fail to adhere to their terms of service.

Unsurprisingly, when requested to justify their arbitrary recommendation - they couldn’t!The Ombudsman’s defence of Powershop, in their pathetic excuses for poor service, was second to none. They supported COVID-19 as a primary reason for poor communication of an essential service. They defended a 55000 unit error in opening meter reading, by giving a fairy tale theory on  closing energy meter assessments ( after photographic evidence and multiple readings had been provided).

May as well get their moneys worth right?Cold calling is supposed to be illegal, so why is it being allowed by this service? Being mislead by energy brokers and given false information about reduced rate contracts and being backed into a corner, conveniently the only part of these sales calls that are required to be recorded is the part where you agree, not the part where you are given false info about what you are signing up to. Oh and the contract info doesn't get posted out to you until after their cooling off period. So no backing out guys. They also think its ok to send multiple emails to your energy supplier over multiple weeks to be completely ignored!It's fine though because I'm going to be receiving an apology from the supplier so that generic pre-typed template which N-Power will now add my name to before posting out, is going to make all the difference.There is so much more I can say but let's not waste anymore of my time shall we?Final Note: DON'T BOTHER",Yes,07-May-20,"Hello, we're sorry you have had a bad experience.

If you dare to appeal, they'll remove any prior solution & no redress for your emotional/ mental health caused by harassment from B Gas. They arent neutral at all, they twist things to make you appear at fault. They allow your bill to reach debt collector stage, causing further anxiety WHILST your complaint is under investigation & are reluctant to see your point.They dont honour requests to put bills on hold so the provider can bombard you with demands in the interim. They also deny the proof you send them. Due to being funded by the exact company you're complaining about, theyre very biased. I had to be very specific about certain points of my complaint as they dont read the information you provide fully. Awful, stressful experience with an unacceptable resolve that I wasnt happy with but had no choice. They know your hands are tied so unless you have the money to go legal/ court with the biggest utilty company, you're just expected to take whats offered & shut up.

They often respond on here with 'if you're unhappy, complain to us'  They don't realise, we shouldn't have to resort to that when we are already stressed out by the unfair outcome.

United Kingdom,11,1,12-Mar-20,3,1,2020,After a number of issues with my…,"After a number of issues with my broadband provider PlusNet (PN), on 4.8.2019 I cancelled the contract and requested an Early Termination Charge (ECT). On 5.9.2019 I began a contract with another provider. On 13.9.2019 I paid the ETC to PN for the remaining 9/10 months of the contract. On 6.10.2019, I received an email demanding payment for services which had not been provided by PN. On 7.10.2019 I engaged in a ‘Live Chat’ with PN and told them I had already cancelled the contract and paid the ETC. This was confirmed by PN. After a number of further demands for payment from PN via email and texts to my personal Mobile telephone, on 22.10.2019 I contacted the Ombudsman Services (OS) who created a file of my complaint. Having provided all the relevant evidence available to me at that time, I was hoping this action would stop PN from harassing me. My hope was the proverbial ‘……. in the wind’. On 4.11.2019, I received a letter via Royal Mail from PN demanding payment and threatening ‘Debt Collection Agencies’ should the payment not be made. I immediately contacted PN by telephone and during my conversation with them, …… appeared shocked and surprised I was still receiving demands because the records showed I had cancelled the contract and paid the ETC. That same day, I saw the following comments from PN on the OS case file, “Due to the cancellation of the account and direct debit the final invoice is not honoured and still showing outstanding”. These comments could have only been entered by PN between 22.10.2019 and 6.11.2019, when PN knew I had already contacted them on 2 separate occasions and they agreed with me, that I owed them no money. Due to the stress and anxiety the threat of a Debt Collection Agency was causing me, on 15.11.2019, I sought legal representation and assistance. Having added all the evidence available to me, on the OS case file, I saw the following comments from PN on the file, “No further action is required upon the outstanding balance from Plusnet as the fees are owed and confirmed to Mr ……., These are still outstanding due to the direct debit being cancelled”. These comments could have only been entered by PN between 22.10.2019 and 6.11.2019, when PN knew I had already contacted them on 2 separate occasions and they agreed with me, that I owed them no money. Having appealed the OS decision, the OS came to the same conclusion without even requesting PN to provide factual evidence of the alleged monies owed. The OS decision appeared to support PN and the OS resolution of; “Remedy 2, remove any outstanding monies owed from the account”, because there were no charges for PN to remove from the account. Having sought legal assistance, by my accepting this ‘Remedy’, I felt I would be ‘agreeing with PN, in that monies had been owed by myself’ but the monies would be removed from the account. I therefore added no further comments to the OS case file and the file ‘timed out’ after 7 days. I received a total of 18 emails, 8 texts to my Mobile telephone and 1 letter via Royal Mail, demanding monies, which PN should never have sent to me. On 24.11.2019, I reported the same to OFCOM and the ICO (Information Commissioners Office).After further emails and texts to my Mobile demanding payments, on 18.12.2019, I again contacted PlusNet via ‘Live Chat’. PlusNet again agreed I did not owe them any money. On this occasion, PlusNet finally cancelled the contract, (which should have been done on 13.09.2019) and eventually updated their records as so.In January 2020, my legal representatives received correspondence from PlusNet which appears to use the comments from the OS as some kind of defence in their actions towards me.On 11.3.2020, I received correspondence from the ICO which upheld my complaint against PlusNet for breaches of the DPA & GDPR.I am pursuing PlusNet for ‘Harassment, DPA & GDPR’ offences which my legal representatives, White Collar Legal And Admin, based in Liverpool, are handling on my behalf.",Yes,13-Mar-20,"Hello, we're sorry you are unhappy with our service.

They have ignored the fact that I made a £500 lump payment to clear the debt that Green Star maintained that I had, they have completely ignored the amount that I have paid for my electricity over the course of my contract and how that compares with my average usage.

United Kingdom,10,1,01-Jan-20,1,1,2020,Not independent and unfit for purpose.,"I wish I had read this before using the suggested ‘ombudsman’ to dispute massive overcharging by NPower. I wouldn’t have bothered and would simply have gone to court.The Ombudsman Service is paid for by the big 6 energy companies. It charges them £300+ for every claim they handle. Which would be all well and good were they not incompetent and support huge overcharging by the big 6!We started a 3 month contract for electricity with NPower in June/July last year. They failed to set up the direct debit (which was sent in with the contract), failed to send any bills until AFTER the contract had expired and doubled the contracted rates as soon as it had ended with zero notice. I disputed it with NPower. They couldn’t tell me what rate we were now on or why they hadn’t contacted us regarding the dd or non payment of a bill they had never issued (supposedly after 6 weeks of service). They also refused to let us leave until we paid. We went to the ombudsman service who decided..... wait for it......NPower must have sent the first bill because it was generated by their system; We were at fault for not putting the right reference on the dd (sent in with the contract and duly ignored); we should have chased a bill when non were sent! (We were supposed to ‘expect’ a bill after a random 6 week period apparently); NPower were fine to move us onto non-contracted rates (estimated overcharge of £1000) with no notice whatsoever and without being able to tell us the rate they were moving us to. The service is unfit for purpose and a joke. That it is a private company paid for by the big 6 is (in our opinion) fraudulent and ripe for abuse. Before you use this service, consider the courts. It is a waste of time.Footnote - following the response below (typical stock answer to any complaint) we will not bother to ask them to independently verify that their service is appalling and skewed. What is the point of a service that reviews itself and most likely dismisses complaints against itself in the same way it dismisses complaints against the big 6 energy suppliers who pay for its existence? It remains unfit for purpose (in our opinion) and we recommend nobody to use it from our experience. Go to court instead.

I have been incorrectly billed on my gas and electric account on numerous occasions .I called my service provider to complain about this but nothing was done.  I also noticed that they had added extra costs to all of the gas and electric bills that I had received from them without telling me why.I decided to approach the Energy Ombudsman about this, because I was told that they would recorded my complaint, contact my energy provider to get the case file and then assess the current situation to find a resolution based on the evidence submitted by both parties.I was also given the impression that they would try their very best to resolve the dispute fairly and impartially, and they have the power to order the utility company to put things right.However this unfortunately was not my experience of dealing with them for the last year .I found them to be totally bias and not impartial at all.The remedy that was put forward by the investigator was an insult bearing in mind the disgraceful way that I have been treated  and  the length of time that it has taken for the energy company to address my concerns.I would not advise any one to go to the Energy ombudsman if they have a complex dispute that involves a Sum of money totalling over £150 pounds .It is important to bear in mind that their investigation team are not legally trained so they will not always interpret the rules correctly or to your advantage. I would advise anyone with such a dispute as mine to attend their  local CAB or community legal advice service, if they need proper help and want to achieve a satisfactory out come.Their awards in general are also very low.I will not be using their services again they were a complete waste of time.The Utility companies know that they will not be held to proper account by the Ombudsman, so they do as they wish, the fee that they pay to the ombudsman scheme that they sign up to, clearly has a bearing on the decisions that the ombudsman investigators make and 9/10 it is always in their favour.

I get a call from Scottish Power 'Directors support team - customer complaints'. Appeared to be keen to resolve things, but not in my favour!

United Kingdom,7,1,05-Aug-19,8,3,2019,DO NOT WASTE YOUR VALUABLE TIME WITH THIS ENERGY CARTEL RENTAGOB.,"I contacted the so called impartial, "" energy ombudsman,"" in Leeds in March 2019 this year.  My complaint was against Scottish Gas ( aka Centrica, British Gas, and Centrica residential.)  In July/August 2000 I signed up for a dual fuel account with "" NO STANDING CHARGE,"" with Scottish Gas.  Around 2008 I noticed my bills creeping up exponentially ( over and above the normal advertised increases), so I contacted Scottish Gas by phone and was unable to gain any help as the man or woman on the end of the phone only could not understand a Scottish accent ( as he or she was from New Delhi .. where she or he was speaking from.).  Fast forward to today and after 5 months of phoning the Ombudsmans office to complain that I have been being charged STANDING CHARGES for many years before 2013, and receiving letters of platitude from the Ombudsmans office, I have been told via letter and phone that the Ombudsman has decided to side with Scottish Gas. Thus upholding their defence that the standing charges were not fraud ( despite me only ever signing a ZERO STANDING CHARGE contract back in the year 2000.)  And even after me telling the Ombudsman that Scottish Gas will have NO other signatures from me agreeing to standing charges, and if they do they are photocopied fraudulent ones of my original. ( The Ombudsman STILL sided with Scottish Gas)   No surprise really when one discovers that The Ombudsmans Energy office in Leeds is funded by ? Ta Dah ! :- MONEYS RECEIVED FROM PROFITS MADE BY UK BASED UTILITY COMPANIES.  Thus if you are looking for impartiality ?, why not try the small claims court which I intend to do?, at least that way you should get some kind of fair hearing. ( and a reasonable chance of getting your stolen money back)  p.s.  Be in no doubt, if a company decides to add charges to a contract that you neither signed up to nor agree to ?, this is FRAUD. ( No ifs NO buts NO ambiguity.)   The Energy Ombudsman in Leeds is neither fair or impartial, and only out to KILL YOUR TIME to make it easier for the energy company to defend themselves against you in a proper court of law.

All I wanted were bills for the right properties, with the correct charges and information on them. I'd paid the charges, which I'd managed to extract from the body of the bills. The ombudsman has not checked through the information, decided the scramble, which I AND the energy customer services people had hoped he could sort out, is acceptable, leaving me to pay a charge that I do not owe, but is the result of a duplication when the bills were scrambled! Justice not only has to be done, justice has to be seen to be done, and bills, to be legal not only have to add up to the right amount and sort of make sense, they have to record the actual charges for the actual usages.

United Kingdom,1,1,13-Mar-19,3,1,2019,Like talking to a brick wall,"Took a claim to Ombudsman Services about camcorder insurance/warranty in that offer from Domestic & General (provider) was unacceptable.  Sent loads of evidence to OS but they ignored it in favour of the summary on the claim form - even though I had been told at the outset that the summary on the claim form (compiled by them) was not critical and that anything else I had submitted would be taken into account.  Sent more evidence after initial decision but this was similarly ignored and impossible to get anyone else other than the original case officer to look at it.  So my tips to anyone thinking of using Ombudsman Services are:-1) explore all other options first;2) only use them as a last resort;3) assume you are dealing with people that have no academic qualifications and so with the best will in the world will not be able to understand anything that is not relatively simple;4) ensure the claim form contains all the key points that you want investigated;5) don't be taken in by the reassurances provided verbally by them:6) assume you only get one chance to convince them, as trying to get them to change their mind is like pushing treacle uphill;7) be mindful that any complaint you have about OS will not stop them deciding your claim and forcing you to accept/reject their decision in the meantime;8) hope, but don't expect, to succeed.In theory having access to alternative dispute resolution is a good thing, but not if it is unfit for purpose and lulls customers of the companies signed up to OS into believing they will have access to an impartial adjudicator if things go wrong.  What is needed is an Ombudsman to regulate Ombudsman Services!!!I wish I could give 0 stars, it was evident they were not impartial from evidence ignored, total reliance on evidence supplied by D&G and lack of independent research, a national disgrace !

I also required to know by what means John Lewis could access and update our router without notice since this potentially lays it open to attack from third parties. Facilitating such access is an offence under the Computer Misuse Act 1990.The second part was about the billing system, which was admitted had “issues”. I have been repeatedly overcharged and had no access to my bills.  The Ombudsman Service appeared to see no problem with this breach of contract by John Lewis and seemed to be happy with saying that John Lewis might sort it out at some undefined time in the future.In their decision the Ombudsman Service claimed that the sudden resolution of my broadband issues, after many months, when I issued the complaint was “coincidental”. They also appeared to have complete confidence that our router was secure even though John Lewis could not even manage to run a billing system and their security was compromised. (When attempting to view my account I received the message: “The owner of iac.johnlewisbroadband.com has configured their web site improperly. To protect your information from being stolen, Firefox has not connected to this web site.”.)There appears to be no way further to question their decisions apart from one appeal which produced little change. The Ombudsman Service’s complaints procedure does not allow me to question their decision and nor, it appears, does the Independent Assessor.As others have said on this site, I have had to “accept” the decision because otherwise I would receive no redress at all.

United Kingdom,21,1,28-Jan-19,1,1,2019,Didn’t find them helpful with my case. Very disappointed,Didn’t find them helpful in the slightest with my case against Three! I find it frankly ridiculous. They say I never sent them emails which is a lie when I did. They said three never rang me stating it was free cancellation due to all the issues I was facing with them but yet kept sending me letters. They were really useless in this case. I find it disgusting that you let big companies like three treat the public so badly and let them lie. That’s what you are there for. To stop big companies lieing.

United Kingdom,17,1,27-Dec-18,12,4,2018,Ombudsmen service is a joke,"Ombudsmen service have the ordersity to report my previous review stating that it violated the guidelines of trust pilot. I have proff to back up my claims in my review. Because it not favourable to them like other reviews here they want to take it down. I reiterate OS work for the energy companies as such are baised with thier decision making from the onset. I wish people don't use them any more so they can be shut down. They are not fit for purpose. The number of reviews here against OS says it all. They need to re-evalute themselves and stop acting as a dis-service to the public.My complaint they tried to take down is copied below If I could give no star I wouldIf I could give no star I would. I should have looked at these reviews before making my complaint through OS. I was not suprsied when i then got their decision to side with the energy company. I now know they are not independent as they claim, they are funded by the same companies.I have been told by  OS that a meter that charged £870 in one month by first utility company for a 3 bedroom house was not faulty. He said my smart meter installed now although showing lesser usage is because my habit changed as I can now see what I was using. First utility placed me on direct debit from the onset in Nov 2016 on £93 a month and then in Jun 2017 £150 a month. Never missed a payment, but ended up still with £1000 arrears as first utility was charging between £200 to £300 on monthly basis for a 3 bedroom house even in summer . First utility says there is not enough data to compare the old meters with my smart meter ,so I agreed to give more time, however OS decided otherwise to singlehandedly state that he did not believe the meters were faulty on few units her compared even though he acknowledged that the smart meter was lower. Therefore declined my recommendation to provide billing for the winter month till March 2019 ,obviously he needed to close my case . He did not look into the bills I submitted and did not mention them in his conclusion. OS should not be in operation they are not got for purpose. It is no wonder that the people who give good rating here are those that work for the company. I wish people read the reviews before making a complaint through them. Unlike me I didn't until few days ago, I wished I did , I would have just taken the matter to court. OS should not not send me the generic messages they send for reviews. I am not interested. I will be pushed to give another negative review as a response. I hope their actions is discussed in the parliament soon. I think i should start a petition I am certain I will have signatures to agree.",Yes,28-Dec-18,"Hello. Thanks for leaving your review.

United Kingdom,1,1,20-Dec-18,12,4,2018,What a shambles of an organisation,"What a shambles of an organisation, totally biased and subjective decision in favour of the energy supplier. They don’t even deserve one star.Not even a word in critisicing the energy supplier. They didnt even bother to look into or do some research into information that was provided in support of my case.They don’t have a clue with regards to ofgems micro business protection regulations, they just make it up as they go along, or as it suites them or the supplier they are looking to defend. I was missold an energy contract over the phone, whereby I was lied to and led to believe that I was getting a good deal when in fact it was totally against my best interests. Clearly, the ombudsman have not even considered any of the information I sent them regarding the course of events that took place prior to the recording of the  contract. If this isn’t a case of miselling than I don’t know what is. The ombudsman obviously do not believe a word of what you say, but to them,the suppliers are angels and can do no wrong.I asked for my supplier to send me a copy of my verbal contract several times and did not receive it, nor did the answer my email when I asked for an explanation. The ombudsman told me that this was not a violation of terms of license by the supplier.They told me on the phone that the micro business protection rule which states that a contract should not be to the detriment of the consumer or unfairly favour the supplier is aimed at domestic consumers and not at business customers, (what a farce).Consumers are being duped into lengthy expensive contracts by these unscrupulous and scamming energy companies.To conclude, the ombudsman servicemen is completely useless,so dont waste your valuable time with them. The message they are sending to the energy suppliers is you may continue cheating and robbing people in the same manner with our support..",Yes,21-Dec-18,"Hello. Thanks for leaving your review.

Scottish Power had 4 accounts open for our address. They let us switch when we first bought the property and are now billing us and backdating the bill at a higher tariff. The ombudsman haven’t helped at all, I don’t believe they are a fair and impartial service. I wish I had read these reviews before using them. I feel I could have come to a better resolution with the energy company myself. I don’t believe that the ombudsman when making a decision don’t even consider the impact this has on the customer. This is extremely stressful, time consuming and has a huge impact on a households ability to budget and manage their bills. The ombudsman believes that a letter of apology from Scottish power compensates us for all this that has been going on for over 12 months. My advice- NEVER use Scottish power AND don’t use the ombudsman- They do not help resolve in your favour and do not make the mediation less stressful or time consuming. I believe I would have had a quicker and better outcome by continuing to challenge Scottish power myself!!!",Yes,18-Dec-18,"Hello Kevin. Thank you for taking the time to leave your review.

United Kingdom,1,1,09-Dec-18,12,4,2018,Extremely disappointed with the service…,"Extremely disappointed with the service . Had years of problems with my electric meter. All documented, photographed and videoed.Weekly meter readings going back 6 years showing each episode of the meter misbehaving. E-mail records going back over 2 years registering my original complaint. First officially reported over 2 years ago by the company's own meter reader and then by me when apparent use surged to many times my real usage and the meter showed erratic behaviour on the LED (presumably meter error codes).Last year the meter display went blank and was reported again by the company's own meter reader early this year.Later this year apparent use went through the roof and I videoed the meter recording at a rate of 12 units a day when the power to the house was turned off!This was witnessed by the company's own meter reader and their own electrician when he came to investigate.After weeks of trying, and missed appointments, I got them to install a check meter which showed that, during the test, my meter was running over twice as fast as their check meter.Clear cut. Absolute proof of a faulty meter with hard evidence running back years.The Ombudsman's decision? Somehow the Ombudsman has decided that the fault with the meter appears to have started at the end of August, 3 weeks AFTER I officially reported the meter to the electric company to ask that it be replaced! So I'm not entitled to any refunds for being over-billed prior to that!Apparently, I must psychic and predicted the problem was about to occur 3 weeks in advance.The company also took 5 weeks to arrange an appointment after the fault complaint. They are required by law to do this in 5 working days.The ombudsman's decision?The Ombudsman has decided that since the company made a note on their computer that an appointment was required that this is enough to meet the 5 working days limit even though they made no attempt to make an appointment with me for 3 weeks and the earliest appointment was a further 2 weeks after!This shows the Ombudsman has no understanding of the regulations that govern reports of meter faults.For information to others, the little known regulations on the required performance of energy supply companies, specifically when dealing with reports of faulty meters and booking and keeping appointments, can be found by searching for The Electricity and Gas (Standards of Performance) (Suppliers) Regulations 2015",Yes,10-Dec-18,"Hi Paul.

Eon charged us over £300 for one month for a 1 bed apartment!! We refused to pay until the bill which was clearly incorrect was rectified. After that my energy supplier tried to palm me off with a template apology then threatened court action rather than dealing with my complaint if the bill was not paid. After a deadlock I went to the energy ombudsman who didn't even look at the documents I'd sent in, instead repeated back to me near word for word the deadlock letter which was missing half of the failings and mistakes, then offered me a mere £25 more than what the energy supplier did! The response from the EO was just got a copy and paste exercise!For an impartial service it feels completely one sided defending the energy companies! rest assured I will pursue this matter further.No wonder energy suppliers are unregulated there is a degree of corruption from Energy Suppliers and no accountability for their actions.

After several weeks disputes, Os made a decision that  we need pay this nonsense bill because there is no evidence   of incorrect bill and there is no chance to check the meter.  This is terrible bad logic. I can't image that someone living in 2bedroom flat can use that much electricity, but Os think that there is nothing incorrect.Os didn't do any investigation and made a very unfair decision.

United Kingdom,13,1,22-Oct-18,10,4,2018,Energy Ombudsman Services is frustrating! Bias decision making,"Ombudsman Services - Energy was suggested to me to have an unbiased decision and thorough investigation to resolve a dispute I have with Scottish Power. To start my case, I have been a loyal customer of Scottish power for nearly 4 years, paid regularly & upto date, never hindered anyone to do meter readings for our flat. All of a sudden, Scottish power has put my credit status to a debt of £2200 for 1 year electricity usage. This is a small 2 bedroom flat with no power hungry appliances we are referring to. The reason apparently is they have now CORRECTLY adjusted my bill and that they were only estimating my bills before. Obviously, I did not agree to this as their main responsibility is to do atleast TWO meter readings in a year. WHICH THEY HAVE NOT DONE as I've never seen any operative of them do it or knocked in our flat to ask for the cupboard to be opened. Then, multiple correspondence came through claiming that they have done meter readings but not encoded them for some reason. Scottish power now tries to bully the consumer and just sends generic replies.I asked for some help as suggested with OMBUDSMAN SERVICES - ENERGY but turns out to be a total waste of time. The investigation officer will just basically say that he is satisfied with Scottish power's corrective action. Few points:1. I have informed the EO officer that my scottish power case reference 16011335792 was initially handled by K** of Scottish Power and has advised me that they lack the man power to do meter readings. I have stated the exact date and timing of the call. The EO officer just said he didnt receive any evidence of this, I told him details and should enforce the investigation. Instead, he just agreed with Scottish power's non-agreement to the statement and said it does not change the outcome of the complaint.2. The EO officer stated  I do not consider the company’s failure to issue correct bills acceptable and the company is aware of this. However, this does not affect your responsibility to pay for the energy you have used. THAT'S THE MAIN REASON OF THE DISPUTE!! IF SCOTTISH POWER WAS DOING THEIR JOB OF PROVIDING ACCURATE BILLS AS PROMISED BY THEM, I WOULD'VE EITHER CHANGED ELECTRICITY PROVIDERS OR HAVE GONE FOR A FIXED MONTHLY BILL. SCOTTISH POWER SHOULD LET A CONSUMER KNOW, SO THAT A CONSUMER CAN CHECK WHAT IS CAUSING THE RISE OF THE BILL OR GIVEN THE OPTION FOR CORRECTIVE MEASURES. THIS IS A CUSTOMER'S LEGAL RIGHT TO HAVE AN OPTION ON AND HAVE A CHOICE NOT TO BE PUT IN DEBT. But yeah as previously mentioned, the EO officer does not seem to comprehend that and thinks what he's saying is correct without basis.ALL I was asking is fairness but clearly using this service does not entail that! The officer even had the decency to insult me to have scottish power issue an apology letter, how is that meant to solve the issue? Anyway, I still have so many points to go on with but will end up in deaf ears of EO. So my advice, unless they do an overhaul of their processes, not be too favourable to these electricity giants, actually do the investigation and enforce what they have to, DO not use! , nothing more!",Yes,23-Oct-18,"Hi Rainier, we' re sorry to hear you're unhappy with our service.

I am sure that the EO thinks they did a jolly good job in my case. They found in my favour, awarded compensation, told the energy company to calculate my bills manually and close my account, so refunding any credit balance. Apparently this has been done... because the energy company says that it has!I have proved that I have not received an accurate bill. I have proved that no compensation has been paid. I have proved that the account has not been closed. Balance refund is a far off dream. Apparently there is no “check reality” in their workflow so reality is irrelevant. They are not interested. So after eight months, off to court. I should have done this in the first place. Amazing to think that this company has the opportunity to take some of the stress off our overworked, underfunded courts, but they just manage to make it more complicated.

Provide the same evidence you intend to provide to ombudsman to a free independent (no commitment) solicitor and compare their initial proposed response / solution.

This is evident from the appalling reviews and rating on this platform.My suggestion?

In my case, the supplier did not comply within the 28 day period and after that the EO simply said that they would ""monitor the situation until the supplier has complied"".  This basically gives the supplier an open-ended target date to comply, it could be this month, next month or in 6 months time and the EO can then claim that they have fulfilled the obligation of their service.

Had to take it to the Energy Ombudsman in July 2023 to ensure someone independent, with authority, can make common sense to the issues with my complaint.  However, a day in August when my energy provider admitted all the errors and provided me a final response letter... within one hour, the Energy Ombudsman closed the case.  The energy provided promised many resolutions on the complaint final response, which they have not kept to.  I have since gone back onto the online portal, with picture evidence, about the issues, but I'm having no response.  I feel that there is no after service with the Energy Ombudsman.

Just to clarify, it is now weeks since I raised a formal complaint about the way the case had been handled and no one beyond the original case handler has been in touch with me. My perception is that relationships between your staff and with the energy suppliers are too ‘cosy’. Even though I clearly quoted from your ‘Terms of Reference’ to support my complaint, I sense a marked reluctance to acknowledge when things go wrong and persistence by the complainant is not viewed kindly by your staff. My case reflected a failure of proper billing extending over several years, yet you allowed the energy provider to simply walk away when they felt they’d done enough. What kind of justice is that?REVIEW:I had previously written a positive review based on my initial experiences. I received some of the money I was entitled to from the supplier, but not all and, in the end, I was left out of pocket and aggrieved.My complaint was upheld, but the case handler, who said she had only been in post for a short time, did not write up her report properly and, although she clearly referred to the need for the supplier to refund me in the body of the report, this requirement was not specifically included in the remedies section. As a result, I was told that, although a full refund of all monies due was a fair expectation, she could not enforce this. I pointed out that, as the error was not mine and my original complaint had clearly requested a full refund, the Ombudsman’s own ‘Terms of Reference’ clearly allowed for the omission to be rectified. I calculated I was still owed several hundreds of pounds by the supplier. I was bluntly told that the case was closed. Throughout the resolution phase, which extended well beyond the stated time limit of 28 days, communication from the supplier was very poor. The company could not answer my reasonable questions about the outstanding money they owed me. The Ombudsman simply said that I was unlikely to hear further from them. Considering that the case arose entirely from the supplier’s negligence and my complaint had been upheld, I found this response disgraceful.Despite the supplier being well aware of my remaining concerns, the Ombudsman told meI’d have to start the complaints process over again, including giving them a further two months to consider my submission that they had underpaid me. I was told that I could then reapply to the ombudsman for redress! This was notwithstanding their own rule which prohibits a new case being opened based on substantially the same facts as the original. Quite bizarre. I felt I was being fobbed off:I raised a formal complaint with the Ombudsman Service as I considered I had been unfairly treated. My experience was that the process is biased in favour of the supplier and is not as independent as it should be.To date, no one has responded to the complaint and it seems that that the supplier is free to do whatever it likes. Rather than refunding me every penny due, or properly explaining their own calculations, I’m simply ignored and treated as a nuisance. The attitude is, “Take it or leave it” in my experience.Far from implicitly upholding the rights of the public, the process is, in my experience, unfair, deficient and leaves the complainant with a profound sense of injustice. That cannot be right.",Yes,14-Sep-23,"Hello, we're sorry to hear that you haven't had a positive experience when using our services.

United Kingdom,1,3,21-Mar-23,3,1,2023,Bulb let off the hook again with expedient solution.,"In response to Ombudsman services reply which  confirms the criticism. The principle of all Ombudsmen schems is to decide what is 'fair and reasonable'. Beyond that, an Ombudsman has wide discretionary powers. It is self evident, if a company manifests policies and processes that are unfair, it is necessarily incumbent upon the Ombudsman to address those issues in advocating what is in principle fair and reasonable. Ombudsman Services seem to have a rather stunted notion of what their responsibilities and remit actually are. Here follows the initial review:   Initial decision was utterly vacuous, so in effect the same complaint had to be made against Ombusman Services. Eventually came up with a fudge; an incomprehensiblly reasoned argument and a £60.00 award, which did not address the root cause. Although awarding a minor penalty against Bulb Energy, Ombudsman Services did not address the core issue, ie the culture of impunity. So, following OS's decision Bulb have carried on behaving exactly the same. Addressing the symptoms and not the cause will never change behaviour. It actually encourages businesses to abuse the system, because they use the ombudsman as a backstop to the business's own complaints resolution process, knowing that the consequences (eg £60.00 'compensation') are probably cheaper than resolving complaints themselves. The Ombudsman concept is a good one one, but it does not work in practice because it is tacit rather than incisive, and expedient rather than decisive. A sop to Cerebus.",Yes,22-Mar-23,"Hi Will. As a dispute resolution service, our role is to resolve the dispute between the consumer and their energy supplier.

Instead of supplying my warehouse  with power, as they claimed and I expected, they took over the meter of my neighbouring property, didn't send them a bill for a year, and then when I had found out their mistake via Western Power and proved they had taken over the wrong meter, they still would not accept this.Then when the Ombudsman had found in my favour, Scottish Power refunded my payments for the last two years on my house, (I had used Scottish Power for electricity there for three years) which I told them about immediately.  However, they didn't accept this, opened a new account for the period using the wrong tarriff and wrong standing charge.  Although I told them this in writing and via phone, they did not accept this, and put the matter in the hands of debt collectors.  Only when the deadline the Ombudsman set for Scottish Power to send me a correct bill to pay back when they had paid me, did they do so.My  complaint to the Ombudsman is that it is a pity they cannot act sooner as I imagine most customers will have already spent considerable time with resulting stress, trying to sort the problem out themselves.  Also Ombudsman should have the power to fine and severely reprimand these utilities, especially Scottish Power as they make mistakes and then are completely incapable of correcting them.Otherwise the operative assigned to my case at the Ombudsman service was courteous and kept me informed of developments both via phone and messages.",Yes,28-Jun-22,"Hi Anne, Thank you for taking the time to leave us your feedback!

United Kingdom,23,4,23-May-22,5,2,2022,Unhappy with level of compensation,"Overall, happy with the Ombudsman service level I received, and I would always recommend that people use the Ombudsman service for any unresolved complaints, however, after starting this particular process, I discover that compensation is fixed, whereas I feel it should be offered at a level comensurate with the level of time taken to put the case together, and the amount of distress caused to the compainant by the company they are dealing with (in this case Scottish Power).",Yes,24-May-22,"Hi Yvonne, thank you for sharing your feedback with us! It's good to hear that you would recommend our services and were satisfied with the service you received. Although monetary awards we offer are not fixed as you say, we do have to take in to account similar cases we may have dealt with and the level of distress caused when deciding on the value we offer. Many customers may value their time at differing amounts and it would not be fair for us to base the level of compensation on an individual's personal circumstances so we do take a balanced approach in this respect. I would once again like to thank you for taking the time to write about your review and I hope we can help again should you need us in the future!",1

Ofcom have NO teeth to improve customer problems... The Ofcom Ombudsman engaged to resolve my problem did not understand the technical workings of Mobile technology so made a decision based on ignorance of the working system & poor signal problems involved. So I wasted my time & work trying to improve matters. The whole process I found to be a formality and after months with the ombudsman, I’m back where I started, forget the whole matter or Do It Myself... I believe this is another reason companies advertise that they are doing a great job when there is no one to give them a hard time to change poor business practice etc. So disappointing...what a letdown...",Yes,28-Mar-22,"Hi Rob, We are sorry to hear that.

I have received two compensation payments. What I did not achieve was getting proof that Scottish Power systems had been changed to ensure other customers did not fall through the cracks like me. At times, I had the feeling that a Ombudsman Services member of staff was not familiar with the history of the case.  I have the impression that the number of complaints staff have to deal with stretches the resources they are given.

A series of emails from them failed to resolve this. Having received the '8-week letter' from Octopus I referred them to the Ombudsman. This instigated a very quick response from Octopus so that I did not have to pursue the matter further with the Ombudsman beyond the first referral, other than uploading the email evidence.I could not work out how to upload a long series of emails to the Ombudsman site so I phoned them and despite my hearing impairment the person on the other end of the line spoke very clearly, and the line was good.

The process does highlight an issue as it relies on all parties being fully forthright at all stages including prior to the Ombudsman involvement.

I am not yet convinced that their flawed estimation system has been corrected but we will see. Symbio's service is still very slow or non-existent though. The huge direct debits caused me severe distress and financial hardship and got me into trouble with other bills, so the only reason I have not given 5 stars is that I would have liked more compensation for the stress and financial hardship that Symbio caused me and my family.

When I was £1,000 in credit, I suddenly got a quarterly bill from them for £1,000 , although they had set my direct debit at £100 a month.  I do not want another such bill and them claiming we have been underpaying-they set it at this and now we have no way of monitoring it.

In brief I had two issues, one for which I accept that I cannot hold British Gas responsible, but the Ombudsman's investigator would not directly address the second issue, even after an explicit question of the acceptability of BG's action (well, non-action really). They said they had take it into consideration, and simply restated that they had made their decision, and I should follow other avenues If I was not happy with it. Only after posting my initial 2 start Trust Pilot review, which expressed my annoyance and stating that a direct answer, even if it were not in my favour, would be better than a 'computer says no' response, did I eventually receive a direct response. Alas, it wasn't in my favour, but at least I had a full explanation and understood the decision.",Yes,08-Apr-21,"Hi Robert,  Thank you for your feedback.

No one called, no one sent her a letter, ignored my messages trying to explain that this was a delicate situation.

United Kingdom,4,3,17-Sep-20,9,3,2020,Erroneous transfer still uncorrected 1 year later,"My 90 year old widowed mother's gas supply was erroneously transferred last year. This was discovered in September 2019 and the Company concerned was instructed to restore the supply to her original provider whom she had regularly paid by direct debit. She was told the supply had been restored. Nobody bothered to tell her it had not as there was apparently money due to the new Company with whom there was no contract. They started to send offensive letters demanding money which Mum assumed had already been paid based on estimated bills. on the 18th March 2020, the weekend before COVID lockdown, she received notice of disconnection on the grounds of non communication even though there were phone calls e mails and finally recorded delivery letters all of which had been ignored. Mum, a retired judge for whom I hold power of attorney, was in tears at such cruel and callous behaviour showing total disregard for the circumstances which the Company had been fully made aware of. The local MP's office was extremely helpful in calming this lunacy down but we had to pay almost £250 on top of what had already been pain to get this ghastly company who are currently spending large sums on sport sponsorship off our backs. The local Social Services were completely hopeless when presented with as clear a case as I seen of adult safeguarding as a result of of corporate abuse.   The Company when pressed eventually offered £50 which they then upped to £160 when they were told the statutory compensation for not correcting the erroneous transfer was £60! When there was correspondence, delayed by COVID, individuals were pleasant but one got the impression they were hampered by the very tight negotiating criteria they had been set.  They made the problem out to be slow correction of the erroneous transfer as opposed to the endless failure to engage with inconvenient correspondence. The apology offered seemed very lukewarm hence the Ombudsman was approached. Whilst the process was relatively easy for those who are IT literate, sadly my Mother is not- in common with most 90 year olds. The service could be more inclusive. However, we got there in the end. Progress was significantly slowed by COVID - no fault of anyone but from the formal complaint to the Company to the decision was almost exactly 6 months. The Company's rebuttal letter to the Ombudsman, where they reduced the offer back to £50, was very poor- full of factual inaccuracies and comments never supported by documentation. Using a sporting analogy they were playing the man not the ball.  In the ruling, the Company were 1) ordered to repay all sums they had received ( complied with), 2) write a letter of apology which was extremely superficial and provided no insight as to how this procession of horrors had arisen. No apology has been received at any stage for the outrageous threat of disconnection.3) Compensation of £150 plus £60 statutory payment for missing deadlines on restoring the erroneous transfer. The cheque is apparently 'in the post'. This level of compensation seems to be high on what the Ombudsman  normally awards  but would appear to me to be very low given the grossly aggravated circumstances and the very large amount of time spent by me, a Doctor, in defending my mother. Rest assured I have had far better ways of spending my time. 4) Restoration of the supply to the original provider- a phone call to them last week confirmed that this had yet to be completed by the offending Company a mere 50 weeks after they were originally instructed to do so. I emailed them last week; no reply of course. The request that this case be referred to the regulator to assess whether the Company was fit to hold  a licence was declined on the grounds the Ombudsman did not have the power to do so. This is deeply frustrating and all I got were a string of platitudes in the 'apology' letter from the Company. I am left with a taste of the Emil Savundra insurance scandal of the late 1960's. The erroneous transfer has still not been corrected and I get the impression the Company concerned  sees the involvement of the Ombudsman as the equivalent  of a wrap across the knuckles by a fly. What if my Mum had been forced to pay almost £250 extra for her gas based on an old age pension as her only income? What if she had not had a power of attorney who has fought many such prolonged battles of will as part of his profession or indeed if  she had not been legally qualfied and still mentally competent?  The Ombudsman can only give a ruling based to terms of reference, hence a 3 star not a 1 star rating. It is accepted cases such as this are uncommon but it is very clear the Ombudsman needs to be given some much more powerful teeth to deal with such appalling cases.",Yes,18-Sep-20,"Hello, thank you for your review on our service.

Regrettably, my experience with their service was nothing short of frustrating and disappointing. The Ombudsman Service failed on multiple fronts, including their failure to inform me about the limited scope of my complaint, their lack of comprehension regarding the complaint's magnitude, and their complete disregard for BT's significant failings.To begin with, the Ombudsman Service's initial failure to inform me that they could only address a part of my complaint was both surprising and unprofessional. It is crucial for any service provider to be transparent and set realistic expectations from the outset. Sadly, the Ombudsman Service neglected this fundamental aspect, leaving me with false hope and a false sense of resolution.Moreover, their lack of comprehension regarding the full scope and complexity of my complaint was truly disheartening. It became increasingly evident that the Ombudsman Service did not possess a thorough understanding of the intricacies involved. As a result, their inability to grasp the gravity of the situation led to a superficial analysis that failed to address the core issues at hand.One of the most troubling aspects of my interaction with the Ombudsman Service was their failure to acknowledge and hold BT accountable for their significant failings. Despite providing substantial evidence of BT's negligence and misconduct, the Ombudsman Service seemingly turned a blind eye to these serious transgressions. This lack of proper investigation and enforcement undermines the purpose of their existence and leaves customers like myself without any real recourse.Furthermore, the overall communication from the Ombudsman Service was extremely poor. They exhibited a concerning lack of responsiveness and failed to keep me adequately informed about the progress of my complaint. It felt as though my concerns were brushed aside and not given the attention they deserved.In summary, my experience with the Ombudsman Service in relation to my complaint against BT was highly unsatisfactory. Their failure to inform me of the limited scope, lack of comprehension regarding the complaint, and unwillingness to address BT's significant failings have left me disillusioned and frustrated. I expected a fair and impartial resolution, but instead, I encountered an organization that appeared ill-equipped to handle the task at hand. I would caution others to carefully consider seeking assistance from the Ombudsman Service based on my unfortunate encounter.",Yes,09-Jun-23,"Hi Adam, we're sorry that you haven't had a positive experience when using our services.

The Energy Ombudsman has been involved for more than half of the duration with one failed attempt to resolve after another, when the final decision was made months after going through the process, 5 actions were to be carried out by my Energy Provider, 2 of which were completed and 3 were either done incorrectly or not at all, My energy provider even went as far as to transfer my entire credit balance and Gov Energy payments to debt reduction during this process and this has been accepted by the Ombudsman with whatever evidence my provider gave to them. But the nail in the coffin, before I even had a chance to dispute what my provider was claiming the Ombudsman closed the case of 4 months without even consulting with me that the actions have been carried out. They seem to be impartial up until the very end when the providers word is gospel. The agent handling my case was polite and very helpful throughout and that is the reason for an additional star, however I have a problem with this process and how easy the energy companies can manipulate it at the end.[Update 05-01-2023]: I am now aware that my case has been escalated, although technically showing as closed.

On the positive  note they did weedle a token £ 30 out of British Gas but the substance of my complaint about the standing charge including the debts of unconnected third parties remained unaddressed.

Things could have been resolved a lot quicker if they understood more about what was and wasn't important to the client.I had a really serious concern that was causing me anxiety about my case.

United Kingdom,7,2,04-Jul-22,7,3,2022,They support large corporations but not small businesses,"We were so upset by the decision of Ombudsman services in favour of BT. The compensation (1 year of free internet) , which we originally asked for, is very modest compared to the damage that BT did to us: we were completely without a phone and internet 6 weeks - just a week after we bought a small hotel and just wanted to change the name of our contract with BT.  Absolute chaos and disorganisation and miscommunication in BT has led to this deplorable situation.  Unfortunately we could not change our telephone and internet provider as BR has a monopoly in our area - Yarrow Valley, Scottish Borders. We have lost a lot of clients, our mental health has deteriorated due to constant stress due to this situation.  We brought a huge number of facts, but, unfortunately, Ombudsman did not support us but the huge BT corporation.  One more fact that your investigator said it was not fault of BT but their supplier OpenReach, which is a part of BT! But our contract was with BT and not with OpenReach, it’s BT’s function to control their own suppliers. If you cannot do it - change your supplier. We cannot even imagine a situation where we could tell our own customers: sorry, it’s not our fault but our suppliers!Of course, we had the opportunity to challenge your decision, but we were morally tired of it, so we decided to agree to these humiliating 3 months of compensation from BT. It is very unfortunate that an organisation like yours does not stand up for the rights of a small business like ours, despite the evidence we have provided against a large corporation like BT.",Yes,06-Jul-22,"Hi Oxana, We are sorry that we were unable to issue you with the outcome that you were hoping for.

It may be the case that, whilst we don't doubt the stress that this situation has caused, BT have already taken steps to rectify the situation. Unfortunately, Openreach is not a communications provider, they are contractor provided by BT and we would expect BT to liaise with Openreach to provide a timely resolution however, we are unable to penalise BT for shortfalls with Openreach.

But when the deadline came and went they were toothless in forcing SP to do what they were required to do. I had to constantly keep going back to them and each time they'd give SP a fortnight to respond and then I'd hear nothing.However SP did eventually implement Ombudsman Services' resolutions, albeit fully 6 months after the so-called deadline. It was worth it, as it meant my mother-in-law was £750 better off. However it's fair to say that she would not have had a penny if I hadn't stepped in, she's 83 and wouldn't have known where to start. So in that respect it's an unfair service.Plus it took repeated efforts on my part to finally force it over the line.Part of the problem was that SP can only be described as a shambles.

Opus, soon after cancelled the contract they had with my then neighbour at 7A who had a direct debit in place with them, they then started billing me for both meters saying ‘I am the main contracted customer’!This escalated into me receiving multiple daily phone calls from opus threatening to hand the unpaid debt to a debt collection agency, which indeed they did. I could not make them understand , so I had no choice but to contact Ombudsman, who acted fairly quickly, the result was, I was pressured to agree with their findings (which had gross inaccuracies) . I was told I would receive an official written apology from Opus and a small compensation payment for their failings, but I’ve received neither.

I do think that in reality the ombudsman doesn’t consider the stress, upset and uncertainty that poor decisions, communication, broken promises and inadequate management from an energy supplier can cause and the settlement doesn’t really reflect this (it seems that the energy suppliers know this is a standard ‘penalty fee’ as the same settlement (including apology letter) was offered 3 months into the 6 months fiasco), does make you wonder how effective the process is and whether this is already budgeted accordingly as part of the meter process?As for the apology received from the energy supplier, this was a standard ‘cut and paste’ response and the ombudsman thinks this is acceptable.  There needs to be more accountability and scrutiny of the energy suppliers as this will happen again to someone else with no lessons learnt.  Just to add the reason I used the ombudsman is to keep the pressure on the energy supplier as no matter what i did I was not getting any progress, so at least this helped.",Yes,10-Jan-22,"Hi Mike, We understand that complaints can be frustrating and stressful for consumers however, consumers have different emotions and feelings towards their disputes and their suppliers and as a result its too difficult for us to establish a fair and consistent Goodwill gesture payment based on this.

Worse than that I was unable to submit a meter reading on their website as previously had been the case.After getting nowhere with SSE and multiple worldwide call centres I lodged an official complaint and after 6 weeks of further inaction took it to the Ombudsman.The complaint process was clear and logical to follow and resulted in acceptance of a 2-part resolution.1) Written apology from SSE.2) Payment as gesture of goodwill.All good so far but I was somewhat disappointed when the matter was closed as ""The company has confirmed that it has implemented all resolutions required on the case.""This was NOT the case as the company had NOT sent me an apology (they had sent the Ombudsman a screenshot of an apparent apology!) neither had they paid me the agreed £75.(They were also sitting on an over payment of £250 owed to me as they had no readings for 9 months)I pointed out that I had accepted the 2-point resolution proffered but this had not been carried out so why was Case Closed? Ombudsman replied that the case was considered ""closed"" if the company ""said"" they had complied which seems to strongly favour SSE's word and not mine.I still haven't received an apology from SSE but I have received the monies owed to me.I will not be dealing with SSE (or nPower) ever again.",Yes,28-Jul-21,"Hello, We are sorry that you feel the remedies required by SSE have not been completely fulfilled.

I made complaint and was told there is nothing the company can do and I have to pay that £1000 bill. I took it to ombudsman and over the phone explained the issue.

UW had time to post their evidence, however on last day they had left to upload it, they contacted me offering settlement, removing all charges and compensating me £75.

I referred to the Ombudsman who were very slow to start any investigation, but in fairness once the case was allocated to someone they were reasonably quick.  However their conclusion simply summarised the correspondence between me and SSE and made no attempt to analyse the reasons for the dispute in the first place.",Yes,19-Apr-21,"Hi Peter, We are sorry that you didn't have the best experience when using our services.

I am completely satisfied with their decision and their process. My only criticism would be that the complaint process itself is a little confusing on the website. I would have liked to be able to go back and edit previous pages once I knew which questions were being asked - I repeated myself several times because I would type everything in my answer to the first question, not realising they would later ask for specific details in a further question on the next page.",Yes,08-Mar-21,"Hi Abi, We are glad that you were satisfied with the decision!

United Kingdom,6,2,06-Mar-21,3,1,2021,I took BT to the Ombudsman because......,"I took BT to the Ombudsman because when I upgraded my service, unbeknown to me a £10:40 monthly discount was removed. Yes I’d had the email stating new charges but if your not told a discount is going to be removed then in your own mind the new bill is going to be minus that sum. It didn’t happen, my bill almost doubled and I complained, first to BT then to the Ombudsman. It took three months to come to a conclusion, which was BT are fab and can you just go away please.( or something along those lines but with  a bit of sympathy) I’d also questioned why, when I was now on Fibre, I had to continue paying £19.99 a month for line rental.BT state you must as it’s part of the package, the only good news I got was that the Ombudsman states we do NOT. if you don’t need your home phone due to your broadband now being delivered by fibre, you CAN cancel. You lose the phone, your number etc, but if your paying for mobiles why fork out almost £20 a month for absolutely nothing.As it stands, I’m now subject to my contract for another 18 months, the Ombudsman is toothless and BT will screw every penny from you they can get, even those of us with nearly 40 years of loyalty. (Not in 18 months time though)",Yes,08-Mar-21,"Hi Martin, We are sorry to hear about your circumstances and understand your concern of being faced with a larger bill then you expected.

All for the big companies, the ombudsman seems to think an apology covers all of your stress and wasted time!",Yes,05-Mar-21,"Hi David, We understand that erroneous transfers can be concerning for consumers! Consumers have the freedom to move energy providers as they wish and the industry has processes in place to ensure that in cases where a genuine mistake has been made in the transfer of a supply (e.g. human error), the supply is returned back to the original supplier and the account is re-opened as though the transfer never took place.  There are different circumstances that cause an erroneous transfer to happen this may involve a third party or a mix up in meter details, but the suppliers main concern will be getting the account back to where it needs to be with as little impact as possible, and our involvement would be to ensure that happens. If you are concerned about how the transfer took place then your energy provider might be able to provide you with more information on this We are sorry to hear that you aren't happy with the resolution to your complaint.

The company did initially deflect and ignored all but it appeared the obudsman's office persisted with reminders. After a telephone call from the company acknowledging that invoices were wrong, the ombudsman's office sent me a message that my case had been resolved and settled!

United Kingdom,9,4,15-Feb-20,2,1,2020,Really Good Experience,"I've had great experience from Ombudsman Services. They resolved my issue getting credit back from Together Energy (who I would advise everyone to avoid at all costs). I do think they need greater powers of enforcement, though.The process did take more than three months - far, far too long for a fairly straightforward issue. The delay, however, was entirely down to Together Energy, who dragged their heels at every stage and let deadlines run down to the last second, even when they had nothing to add to the case. It is only fair to give a company reasonable time to respond, but when they start abusing that time, then they should be penalised for delays in resolving the matter.Having gone through the process,  I do think there needs to be urgent reform of the energy complaints system. I was lucky that the amount of money involved in my case was relatively small and did not cause me any financial hardship - but not everyone who has to go the Ombudsman will be in that position.Ofgem will not take individual customer complaints directly - they appear to take action only when there is evidence of trends of bad practices. So Ofgem is entirely useless for most consumers with complaints, given that, the ombudsman needs more statutory powers. I don't think it really matters if the ombudsman is a private company (although this did surprise me), as long as it is independent. I have found Ombudsman Services independent and fair in my dealings with them.",Yes,17-Feb-20,"Hello, thank you for your review, we're glad we could help you resolve your complaint. - Ombudsman Services",2

United Kingdom,4,3,12-Feb-19,2,1,2019,I am totally in shock in regards to all…,"I am totally in shock in regards to all the negative reviews about Ombudsman services. I was reviewing EDF energy as they completely miscalculated my final bill and refused to pay a credit. To cut a long story short, changed suppliers,large credit on Gas account after final bill. EDF energy customer advisers told me I would receive refund, no refund!! contacted them several times only to learn that they made a mistake and I now owed them. Contacted the Ombudsman services and, after months of investigation they agreed with EDF that the billing was actually correct however the ombudsman agreed some errors were made and agreed to reduce the debt. I was left devastated actually cried like a baby as I knew the information given to me by EDF however the company could not find the recorded call when the adviser called me to inform me I was in credit with my electric account and congratulated me after submitted the final closing read. A few months down the line with my new supplier I suddenly owe this debt for electric, despite the gas being in credit they refused to pay this out to me stating that I owe on the electric, My argument was if I owed on electric and credit on the gas why didn't they just deduct the amount owing the difference from the credit and refund the balance back to me??  I contacted Ombudsman Services as I thought they were there to help vulnerable people like myself when these companies fail hard working customers and twist words to show that we are in the wrong. Despite giving every shred of evidence and relaying back and forth to ombudsman they agreed with the energy company that the billing was correct which left me very hurt and not satisfied with the decision made. I appealed the case however they stuck with there decision. The Ombudsman on line services I must admit I thought was really good as you could view your case add evidence etc and review feedback from the energy companies. I can't grumble with them keeping me updated with my complaint and I did initially speak to a very lovely gentleman on initial contact, however I feel that things were overlooked. The whole experience has left me whether to contact them again in the future wondering whether they would help me with other cases? would they investigate and really listen to our views and opinions to actually scrutinise what we as consumers have to say about these companies and act upon it fairly. There are hundreds of complaints about energy companies mainly in regards to  miscalculated bills and a company which we should build our trust on to help us get justice fails us. I myself feel I am paying for something I do not owe, again one of the top 6 companies can allow to trade and continue to treat people in a unprofessional manner with false billing and incorrect meter readings etc and false promises. I felt I was the only one affected and feeling very bitter about the decision ombudsman have made and sided with a company who have 80% bad reviews. We live in a very corrupt world with a corrupt system which fails people. And who do we turn to? Who else can fight for us back our corner for the right and fair justice.",Yes,14-Feb-19,"Hi Paulette.

The letter I received is the first time I have seen the list of options which should have come from the ombudsmanMy smart meter having had three checks was over reading by 30%I asked for a check meter fitting and was ignored Eventually I was told they were in the process of changing the technicians responsible for the sort of work Which is now complete Yesterday 2nd of July around mid day we had a short total power cut, which resumed quickly, but the strangest of things happened I have a heater plugged into a device which switches the solar panels output to my heater when output exceeds the usage which hasn't worked ever,   Which now works!   running nearly all day SOMETHING STRANGE is going on; it is NOW obvious, smart meters can be manipulated remotely, to what extent is not yet clear but without doubt ! the smart meters can be manipulated remotely!

United Kingdom,5,1,17-Jan-24,1,1,2024,Totally useless service,"I have had serious problems with the Ombudsman. I am 74 and my wife is 73. I have Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia and I am in remission  after 2 bouts of chemotherapy. I am deemed by the NHS as being clinically very vulnerable. One thing I should avoid is stress but the last 9 months dealing with the Ombudsman is the most stressful of my life.I am in dispute with Sainsburys Energy. I have a SMETS 1 smart meter for electricity on Economy 7. The instructions for reading the meter are that R01 is the night rate and R02 is the day rate. These instructions are the same for British Gas and Ovo Energy who have also installed these meters. Sainsburys Energy however believed that the figures were transposed and in October 2022 they changed the readings and charged me back to June 2021. The new figures show the day account at 6447kwhs and the night rate at 15677. So they believed that in the 7 hours of night I consumed 2.5 times more Energy then I did in the 17 hours of day. The Ombudsman accepted it! What nonsense, my wife and I are in our 70's what do they think we do party all night? I spoke to the Ombudsman on the phone and he said 'I can see that from the reading you have used over 15,000 units which does seem high in comparison with the day rate where I would expect the number of units to be higher'. He still let Sainsbury's Energy  go ahead with the rebilling. I challenged this hard and supplied the Ombudsman with more evidence from British Gas and Ovo Energy and he agreed to go back to Sainsburys for more information. They replied that the reason the figures looked wrong is because the meter had 'clocked'. They described it as a fact! It was installed in 2017 and to clock the meter would have had to go to 99,999kwh, then zero, then to the current reading of 23,500kwhs. That is a total of 123,500kwhs in 7 years or 17,500kwhs a year. As I consume less than 5,000kwhs a year it would take me 25 years to consume that much. It is laughable but the Ombudsman bought it hook, line and sinker. The Ombudsman telephoned me on 7th December and we spoke for nearly 30 minutes. He agreed to go back to Sainsburys to request meter readings to check if the meter had clocked and to ask for more information about an engineers visit in April. Sainsburys have told me that they have had no communication from the Ombudsman. He tells me that the matter is closed. I believe he had no intention of taking the matter up with Sainsbury's Energy and deliberately mislead me. I have nothing but contempt for the way this matter has been handled and I have gone through severe stress and had my time wasted by someone who believed everything that Sainsbury's said and ignored all my evidence, which is overwhelming. I don't believe these people are independent at all.The reply from the Ombudsman below is pathetic nonsense. They didn't use any care or consideration in making the decision and they lied to me.They ignored the fact that the machine hadn't clocked and that Sainsburys were clutching at straws, ignored the fact that the machine was set up as R01 nightime and R02 daytime by all the firms that install them, overuled a previous Ombudsman ruling and ignored all facts that contradicted their decision. They told me they would contact Sainsburys for more information and didn't. That was a lie. Useless is an understatement.

I received a bill on the 8th if june 2023 with a a demand letter from Eon next. I wrote to the  Ombudsman who not only showed that they did read the email that were sent by the Eon that their customer service they could not handle their customers now they are puttiing the blame on the agencies. The Ofgem it protects the people with a year back billing of which this was not taken into consideration. It is shame if you deem yourself as a case handler but you are unable to be devil's advocate. Why should i be placed under debt by an irresponsible company to make matters worse the case handler from ombudsmen goes on saying u have a deemed contract when u use electricityWho is responsible to reach out to customers? If the Energy ombudsman can check how many people have been targeted by the same company it will call it to order.

The agent I dealt with was polite and professional. However, having rejected an offer of resolution from the energy supplier (£100 compensation for poor customer service and a justification for the £200 discrepancy but only after I'd accepted their offer), the Ombudsman came up with a worse offer of £80 compensation and a justification of the £200 discrepancy but again only AFTER I'd ACCEPTED THEIR DECISION.This is nonsense, the whole basis of my complaint was that I wanted justification for the £200 discrepancy before I accepted any offer.  Both the energy supplier and the Ombudsman Services made conditional offers providing I accepted their decisions before they would provide the evidence.My advice is not to waste your time with the Ombudsman Services, they have very low compensation limits that they can offer and they don't advise you of these limits before you start the process.

United Kingdom,43,1,17-Apr-23,4,2,2023,OMBUDSMAN SERVICE HOPELESS,"This is the second time I have used the Ombudsman service and both times they have come down on the side of the company. My complaint was against a communications company and the transparency of the  wording they use when selling, explaining their policies and dealing with problems. Because the person dealing with my case, understood the technical language used and because it was legally correct, she said that she felt that they had done done nothing wrong. One of my main concerns was the fact I had been quoted a price for a bundle of 100 texts and 60 call minutes, to use whilst away for 5.5 weeks. It was explained that I would get a part charge up to my 1st billing period, 2 weeks into my holiday, then the bundles would refresh to give me another 100 texts and another 60 minutes of calls, and another part charge would be made on my next bill. I can be clearly be heard to say in the 2nd call I made to the company to check this out, that I really just wanted 100 texts & 60 minutes of calls to last the duration I was away and was it going to be dearer doing it this way, to be told no it won't. I therefore find it difficult to to understand how the Ombudsman believes I was clearly told the process! No wonder these companies are getting away with such bad customer services and what almost amounts to obtaining money under false pretences.  This is why I believe companies are now saying, if you don't agree with their decision, you can now take it to the Ombudsman, because they know, the majority of the time, it seems the Ombudsman service have very little power to tell a company, that they need to make changes and it seems to me, rarely even suggest they do. I have no trust in this service and feel it was a complete waste of my time.I appreciate the reply from the Ombudsman Service, but I have already challenged the decision of the case worker, but she maintained that, as far she was concerned, the company had explained themselves clearly and refused to make any changes to her decision. She said if I wish to take it further, I can go to the CAB, but I'm in a situation, where I just don't have the time to do this. It does worry me that the Ombudsman, I believe, is funded by the companies that sign up to use them; is this why my case worker constantly said, she was not allowed to tell the company this or that or felt that if you clearly ask a question and they reply, with in accurate reply, that it is fine!",Yes,19-Apr-23,"Hi Lorraine, we are sorry that you have not had a positive experience when using our services.

On all 3 occasions the Ombudsman has upheld my complaint against Cooperative energy powered by OCTOPUS energy.

I have just had my 3rd complaint against Cooperative energy powered by OCTOPUS energy upheld. I'm not holding my breath to see if Cooperative energy powered by OCTOPUS energy continue breaking Ofgems rules.

They ended up getting me out from a credit situation and have now put me into £1450 worth of debt to coincide with the worst cost of living crisis in a generation.  The ombudsman upheld my complaint and asked the energy provider to provide me with a letter of apology.  What a joke.  I requested for the energy providers to waive the debt as it was caused by their mismanagement of my account so they gave me a £75 goodwill gesture payment to offset against the debt.

His findings were not clear and shows he spent one day on the case. He said this was due to new evidence. THIS WAS THE EVIDENCE I SENT AND THE BILLS THEY ALREADY HAD!!

The bottom line is that my actual supply and first invoice with EDF was from July 1st 2019, however, earlier this year EDF informed me that my contract was expiring at the end of March 2022, 3 months short of the agreed 36 months.Having no success with EDF to sort it out through their compaints procedure I took my complaint to the Ombudsman who given all of the facts backed up by emails etc. in their wisdom agreed with EDF",Yes,13-Jun-22,"Hi Andrew, We are sorry that we were unable to provide you with the outcome that you were hoping for on this occasion.

You do not help the complainers but the energy company themselves. Awful all they do is side with the energy company, even if they are found to be at fault for deleting calls after having written evidence from them they requested it. The ombudsman will not side with you but the suppliers themselves, seems like this company is getting a back-hand from them as why else would they side with a company who you have proved to be incompetent and a liar? ? ?

United Kingdom,5,1,15-Feb-22,2,1,2022,What a palaver,"My complaint was a simple one, I had been billed by EE for a number of years for a service I knew nothing about. With no evidence, or very little, due to me not receiving any correspondence I started the complaint on the portal which EE replied to. In their reply, they stated that a new service was activated in 2019, which they stated I had been sent bills and updates regularly.Arh! thinks I, this is easily solved, there’s no contract for this. So, I went onto the comments and stated – can I see the contract and that I agreed to this, I was under the impression that it was a service still running from an old orange service I started in 2009 which I was expecting had come to the end of its term!The ombudsmen replied within their decision stating ‘ you can’t expect EE to keep contracts for two years, you should have this from your point of sale, it’s your responsibility to look after your paperwork not EE’s’‘Hold on’, I replied, ‘there was no point of sale, and EE should have a contract that was started two years ago’ “well you can appeal, but I don’t fancy your changes, just click the button at the bottom of the page to appeal’.‘There isn’t a button at the bottom?’, I said ‘ I only had decline or accept?’‘oh it's really small, and now you’ve declined, that’s that, sorry!’What the F*%£ that can’t be right. So, after many phone calls, I finally get the chance to appeal.Great, I can now ask for a contract for a new service that EE say was activated in 2019, the activation of new services including changes of terms and pricing need to opt into, easily asked for, and will resolve the whole thing.I then saw the appeal update ‘Your appeal has been reviewed and as this was an existing service then no contact is needed, sorry goodbye’.But, what, how??? EE said it was a new service, you’re now saying that it isn’t? This doesn’t make any sense???So there you go, the ombudsmen can make up new and interesting arguments to fit any solution as long as it suits the big company that is paying their bills, they don’t even need contracts to be in place we can all just be charged willynilly. Well done ombudsmen, you have shown what a great and non-bias service this is. I look forward to the canned response stating ‘I’m sorry you didn’t get the outcome you wanted…’ try a little harder, be the organisation we all need not one that is getting endless crappy reviews and your staff don't seem to care anymore.",Yes,17-Feb-22,"Hi Sam, We understand that it can be frustrating when you don't get the outcome you had hoped for.

Appealed their decision and instead of £30 deduction on a £1400 incorrect bill got £50. Ridiculous. Even tough the meters are no longer certified and should have been checked/replaced years ago. But the worst part is just lying to my face. Jake Devonport said that the meter in question has now been removed so not possible to test which is a lie. I checked with British Gas, the landlord and the current tenants of that property and the meter hasn’t been replaced at all. I’ve sent Jake a message regarding this as he is providing false information on 27th January and he didn’t even bothered to acknowledge or reply to my message.

United Kingdom,29,1,27-Dec-21,12,4,2021,Ombudsman lacklustre,"By contacting Ombudsman very early September 2021 after the compulsory 8 week wait, I felt confident I would have help with my messy EDF billing issue following GNE going into administration back in January 2021, and EDF taking over as a supplier of last resort (I think they call it).Ombudsman services requested EDF to provide a GNE final bill, and an EDF invoice with the correct opening readings on (not higher guessed readings), -  and a full account Statement showing my total cost of gas and electric from the GNE closing read to date.  Required by me because many invoices EDF produced had incorrect readings and had to be cancelled, with numerous VAT adjustments thrown in.The Account Statement when finally received did not show any charges; only all payments I made, some cancelled charges(?), V.A.T. adjustments and a big credit balance.  I've given up, and only because on log-in I know that EDF  finally produced an invoice on 10th November 2021 with the correct readings on it, will the account automatically adjust and should be OK.My point is - It seems Ombudsman services has not seen the Statement from EDF and has ""closed"" my complaint simply when told it had been produced.  If they had seen it, I am sure they should realise it means not a lot and wouldn't have closed the issue.  I will with pleasure leave the matter to rest, but not a good resolution and an exhausting experience.Not sure whether Ombudsman Services or EDF deserves the 1 Star most, but both of them are great at closing complaints - 5 stars each for that.",Yes,29-Dec-21,"Hi Claire, thank you for taking the time to share your feedback with us.

'Oh, it's not our card, we sell on behalf of AQA Telecom'. Bizarre, it says 'Post Office' on it. The phone card terms and conditions (legal document, I might add) state that customers can complain to the Telecoms Ombudsman. I did that; they said they couldn't help, then said they could, then said they couldn't, then said they could and finally said they couldn't - all within a matter of a few days. Different people each time. They said phone cards don't come under the 2003 Telecommunications Act but the evidence I provided (phone card t's and c's) makes reference to the Telecommunications Act 2003 so it looks like the people at the Ombudsman cannot be bothered to read complainant evidence.Something that shows even more that these people at the Ombudsman don't have a scooby, is that they know that the Post Office admitted wrongdoing by offering the cost of the card but had ignored the inconvenience they caused. I'm an nhs worker with health issues and bought this as a back up way of communication should I feel unwell.

There are times when the supplier may come back to us wishing to dispute the case, this may be if they haven't had 8 weeks to investigate the complaint themselves before it has been submitted to us or if they feel like they have already had an agreement in place with the consumer confirming that the complaint is already resolved. We will then send a message to our consumer advising of the situation and asking them to provide us with more information, if we don't hear back after 10 working days then the complaint will be closed.

This led me to do a little research on the Ombudsman itself. I found out that they are funded by the very companies we complain against. These companies chose to sign up to the scheme and are under no obligation to renew their contract with the organisation. So where is the independence and impartiality of all this? Nice gig for the company though. Cheaper than engaging lawyers, Ombudsman rules too often in favour of the customer they can just leave, taking their funding with them...see where I'm going with this? Classic case of he who pays the piper calls the tune! So don't expect much from this toothless organisation. If it matters that much to you and you have the funds, engage a good specialist lawyer and give these jokers a miss!",Yes,31-Aug-21,"Hi Glenda, thank you for taking the time to share your feedback with us. It's disappointing to hear you felt the decision you received was biased.

That does not mean we are going in favour of the company but just explaining why we cannot comment at all. With regards to companies being signed up to us, Ofcom, the communications regulator, ensures that all Communications companies are signed up to either ourselves or CISAS as an alternate dispute resolution. Companies signed up with us must pay a fee regardless of the outcome of a complaint so it is in their best interest to improve their inhouse complaint handling to try and prevent complaints coming to us in the first place.

United Kingdom,7,1,21-Aug-21,8,3,2021,Awful. Really….don’t bother.,"Awful., couldn’t put the evidence in as I’ve got blockers on my iPad to stop anyone following me.So I had to copy and paste emails,I gave up until the Ombudsman gave me an email address.So I set off again. Then was told it had been decided.So I got  one day to put in the rest of my evidence. Wouldn’t have done any good anyway. Seemingly on e a decision has been made, there is no way the case handler pays your verbal  evidence any attention. The company involved, Ovo then refused to pay me ombudsman’s verdict amount and took a wedge off. What for, I shall never know because my complaint was that it wouldn’t provide me with an itemised bills, going back through the months where I kept asking for them, so I could pay.. and get out .So Ovo decided not to pay the ombudsman’s recommendation..(after yet another fight, it deigned to do so).And I’ve yet to receive the itemised bills requested,Honestly, I’d rather have forsaken the £40 apology money that Ovo said it would put in my account( but didn’t)And  saved myself the bother.I honestly  have no idea what the ombudsman is for if it can’t make companies pay it’s recommended amount , or make it provide the concealed paperwork. If companies can just sneer at its low awards and not pay up, it shows the ombudsman has no power at all.Because if they don’t fear it, they just continue on being exactiy the same.==It’s not all about the money…Contrary to the comment that this was about awards money, it wasn’t.Ovo offered me £40 for botching up my account- badly. I accepted it because I wanted to leave and I couldn’t do so without reading my account to see if they’d put the money into my account. I was very dubious about it thanks to ovo’s complaint handler. It was the ombudsman who  told me that no amount of £40 had EVER  been paid into my account, which is what I’d suspected. So a plus there.Hopefully  I’m to get my money, but it was after yet more argument by ovo - stating it’s entitlement to stop me receiving the whole of the ombudsman’s decision.==I’d of paid £40 to leave…it was that bad over the weeks of emails,£40 is relatively nothing for a company to pay out of its profits. Especially as Ovo had decided the apology sum- not me. If the ombudsman cannot tell a company to pay much more, for negligent behaviour towards customers, they will continue to do so. As it’s all profit. So it needs to change, by law.Even if the extra money goes to pay the ombudsman.It’s public money in, instead of out, after all. To companies,  it’s ‘managed’  profit, if people don’t bother to report it.Given the long and tedious path of getting the Ombudsman to review (in my case…ALL ) the evidence. As stated, I gave up at one point because I could not supply the evidence on its internet site,  via my iPad.So I’d have never have got my ‘apology money’, just by by having the wrong technology.Basically, the ombudsman has little, or no financial power, to protect lone customers.So companies will just carry on as they are ….and profit by it.That’s why it’s almost useless.",Yes,23-Aug-21,"Hello, We are sorry that you have been unhappy with our services.

United Kingdom,6,1,24-Jul-21,7,3,2021,Useless Service to the Public?,"My experience was as many others have commented here - going to the Ombudsman Service was a complete was of time and effort in collating the evidence. Had I been better advised by Citizens Advice and Offgem, then I would have realised sooner that I could take action myself to solve my problems with Scottish Power who had been foisted on me when Tonik collapsed.Their case investigator did not recognise that Scottish Power raised an objection to my complaint by claiming it was premature. The Ombudsman's helpline staff told me that Scottish Power automatically raised this objection to every complaint submitted to the Ombudsman. Why does the Ombudsman not inform Offgem about this underhand practice? This organisation is not fit for purpose as the overwhelming majority of comments indicate. I doubt we are all unreasonable people who cannot accept a decision that does not go our way. My impression is that this Ombudsman will not fully reprimand energy suppliers – they seem to act as an external complaints department for the energy suppliers who fund them and in that respect they are biased. My main concerns are that the evidence was not fully considered and the case investigator ignored the continued bad practice by the energy supplier during the time I awaited the decision which took months to be processed. (An appeal will go to the same person who issued the original decision!) I note some of the former employees have said management encouraged investigative staff to leave positive reviews on the Glassdoor website so potential staff would think it was a good place work. That in itself indicates an unethical approach to addressing problems! Sadly the British public have no recourse to another adjudicator for energy issues...RESPONSE TO OMBUDSMAN'S REPLY: You have clearly misunderstood my review - I did not claim staff reviews of your company were fake!! I merely pointed out that a number of staff reported that they had been told by management to post positive reviews on Glassdoor because they'd had so many staff expose an unsatisfactory working environment. Your response strengthens my claim that Ombudsman staff are incompetent, at best semi-literate and at worst dishonest.I am not sure why you are telling me about objections raised by an energy supplier when a complainant has not waited 8 weeks to submit a complaint. My point was that one of the Ombudsman's helpline staff informed me Scottish routinely claim a complaint is outside the time limit regardless of whether it is, and that is done to delay the process further. Clearly you don't have any reasonable response to give so why obfuscate by waffling about irrelevant details!?",Yes,26-Jul-21,"Hi, We are sorry to hear about the issues you have had when using our services. Once a complaint is raised with us the details are sent over to the provider to review. There are some occasions where a provider may dispute the case for example, if they haven't had 8 weeks to resolve the complaint via their own complaints process first, as this is a guideline set out by OFGEM.

The energy supplier Green. has told them it has completed all when it has actually done NOTHING.  I have sent repeated emails plus screen shots of my Green. website as proof, but all I get back is an uncaring response telling me I have to wait another 14 days despite being told that Green. only have 28 days to comply.  I have also been told that they have ""NO LEGAL POWERS""  to force Green. to do as they have promised.  So if Green. just refuse I have wasted many months & achieved absolutely nothing.  I will wait the 14 days, as I have no choice, & if as I expect Green. still do nothing then I intend to start with my MP to get some action to change the whole system.  How can the Ombudsmen say they are impartial when they are actually being paid by Green. this is how they make money, that are NOT a government controlled body.  They are NOT impartial, something I can prove with their repeated actions in my case that did not help me but gave Green. more time which they just used to continue to do NOTHIN G.

United Kingdom,18,1,05-May-21,5,2,2021,Waste of time,"Like many people I used this service as a last resort after repeated complaints with plusnet went nowhere as they have no actual complaint handling process (other than perhaps adding a sticky note to say you complained once but you won't get any different treatment, or a case handler, proper follow up or anything). I suffered horrendously poor intermittent connection for 2 months at a time repeatedly last year with speeds of less than 2mbps (at times 0mbps) which made it impossible to get anything done, and this too at a critical time when many were reliant on home broadband to work everyday. Despite collecting screenshots of wired speed tests, providing full transcripts of online tickets, etc. this was not enough proof for the ombudsman who place the burden of proof on the consumer. The only thing I could've done in addition is make an audio recording of every single call (which is probably illegal without asking consent), video my daily experience, and get testimonials from my colleagues who observed the daily struggle - though this too would not have been enough for the ombudsman. Plusnet didn't do a lot and kept running me through the same troubleshooting nonsense each time of switching the router off, doing a speed test, etc. An engineer was sent out twice and they blamed plusnet and their router, plusnet blamed the line and openreach. Sometimes plusnet agreed there was a problem on the line sometimes they didn't depending on who you spoke to. Plusnet also blamed wireless issues even though their line tests sometimes showed issues and wired speed results showed poor speeds below the minimum guaranteed speeds. They repeatedly promised to look into things and call me back by a certain date and never did and I had to waste 30 mins or more on hold chasing them every time as no one checked their online ticketing system even though this was advertised as a valid way to get in touch. I basically felt fobbed off by plusnet repeatedly and trapped between openreach and plusnet who were blaming each other. I suffered a lot of frustration and anxiety not being able to do my job at a time when many were losing theirs and I was in a new role, and I also had to work longer hours to make up for lost time. Were it not for being allowed to use my work mobile as a data hotspot, I would've had to spend extra money each month on data connection in addition to broadband to have something that worked whilst I was trapped in a contract. In the end I left plusnet as soon as I was able to after the horrendous experience which anyone would've done. Plusnet also incorrectly continued to bill me after I had left so I had to fight to be refunded for that too.What did the ombudsman think after 2 months of staring at this case? Well plusnet tried to send an engineer and even if the connection was slow, below my minimum guaranteed speeds and intermittent that it was unusable most of the day, it was still on at some point and I used it for a few mins so everything is fine and there is no problem here. Speeds below the minimum don't entitle you to anything other than the ability to leave your contract after 30 days - oh but if you leave your contract there is nothing that the ombudsman can do, so stay trapped and get nothing or leave and get nothing anyway. They take plusnet's results as being more accurate than my screenshots which showed what I actually received at home, so why did plusnet bother asking me to do these tests then?! And as we know, wireless issues and routers aren't covered even if your broadband provider supplies the hardware and most people connect wirelessly and not via ethernet. They need to move with the times and be on the side of consumers and not the company. Plusnet and the ombudsman are both a colossal waste of time. Telecoms should learn about proper complaint handling from banks or even Starbucks who do a far better job.",Yes,07-May-21,"Hello, We are sorry that you weren't happy with the investigation of your complaint.

It's very important to know that Ombudsman Services have no power. They impose no real accountability upon big business. Also, it's very important to understand that if you are offered any compensation at all by the company - however inadequate - you should take it because O.S. have a policy of halving it - they really don't want you to complain about these companies.

The supplier must have claimed the complaint started after I had said even though I provided a copy of the original dated complaint. SP coughed up £50 to keep me quiet. Obvs didn’t want a case to be found against them. So I’m now pursuing a complaint against ombudsman service. Not impressed.So they’ve responded. Total waffle. Do they ever read anything properly? I said I’d already provided a copy of the original complaint email which I sent to SP on 4 January. I then waited 8 1/2 weeks before I contacted ombudsman service.

If there is any discrepancy between the date that the initial complaint was raised then we will give you time to upload evidence that highlights the date the issue was formally raised. We understand that our consumers want a quick resolution, however we have to allow the supplier the opportunity to do this first before we become involved and we check the date of when the initial formal complaint raised with your provider to ensure that we comply with the regulations set out by OFGEM.It may be worth checking these dates with your provider and supplying evidence of your initial complaint and we will be happy to support you in the next steps of your complaint.

Ombudsman services didn’t even follow their own internal processes when Scottish Power ignored the Decision and very little effort to make sure Scottish Power implement the decision. I raised a complaint against Ombudsman Services who conceded their own customer service was awful and hey provided £175 compensation. However they still didn’t make Scottish Power implement the decision and just tried to close my complaint without it being resolved. Ofgem believes that the decision by the Ombudsman is legally binding, however this is not the case. Scottish Power have simply ignored the Ombudsman and not implemented the decision.

United Kingdom,1,1,10-Mar-21,3,1,2021,Ombudsman wasn’t interested in helping consumers to save money,"My complaint about npower was about Economy 7 (cheaper rate at night: more expensive day rate). We weren’t told that our type of meter didn’t change for Summer Time and lost time during power cuts. This meant that for some of the time we thought we were using the cheaper rate when in fact we were unknowingly using the more expensive rate. The Ombudsman didn’t agree that npower should have told us about how the meter works but said that we should have worked it out for ourselves. The meter is complicated and the clock not at all obvious, we only found it by accident. It is specialist information. The decision didn’t support the consumer but allows npower to go on not telling customers and consequently overcharging them. So if you are reading this and you are on Economy 7 or 10, try to find out how your meter works: you could be being over-charged. There is a simple fix: energy companies should tell the consumer about the meters: end of problem.  But the Ombudsman wasn’t interested in helping the consumer. There were also inaccuracies in the judgement, some of it wasn’t logically thought through and it didn’t really grasp what turned out to be a complex issue. Very disappointed. A waste of time.PS The Ombudsman’s reply goes over information we gave them about the Economy 7 hours. We knew all this.  Once again it misses the point and avoids addressing the specific problem with our type of meter and the fact that finding the clock on the meter requires specialist knowledge. Energy companies should be telling consumers so that we can manage our Economy 7 accurately.",Yes,12-Mar-21,"Hello, We are sorry to hear that you weren't happy with your experience.  The 'Off peak' times for Economy 7 meters can vary between suppliers and regions. Generally there will be guidance displayed on the meter which will show when the 'Off peak' rate is.

Our investigations team take great care in understanding and investigating complaints and will have provided a resolution that is fair based on the information they have received. however, we appreciate that sometimes the outcome isn't the one that our consumers hope for and this can cause frustration.We would like to thank you for taking the time to leave us your review.",2

Having spent an exorbitant amount of time lodging 3 years with of evidence, I was initially pleased when the Ombudsmen completely ruled in my favour and Scottish Power accepted their findings and actions. Then for no reason other than Scottish Power saying that they had accepted the ruling in error, the findings were amended and I am now back to square one and once again in dispute with Scottish Power's business division over charges for an account that I've never paid into whilst the domestic account that I'd happily been paying into (as a domestic client) has been inexplicably closed. The complaint is ongoing and I am still burning hours dealing with both the Ombudsmen and Scottish Power - ultimately a very stressful and disappointing process and can only agree with other reviewers in that it's the energy providers that have all the power with complete disregard for the consumer no matter what the Ombudsmen says.

United Kingdom,4,1,03-Feb-21,2,1,2021,Definitely NOT independent!!,"The agents I got sided with Utilita despite back billing regulations definitely applying. And despite Utilita lying. I can confirm 100% that the agents were definitely NOT independent, despite whatever lies the Ombudsman replies to this about independence. Even after an appeal, of which they completely ignored my evidence proving Utilita were lying. They completely IGNORED their OWN rules and deliberately misquoted them to pretend that back billing regulations did not apply, they were determined to rule in Utilita's favour, this biased decision was clear from the outset. They were also not bothered about Utilita breaching the disability discrimination act on a regular basis. They also say I can't do anything else since there has been an appeal (which they reached the same biased decision). Well I could take it to court and you would have a hard time explaining to the judge why you, as a matter of routine, as seen by these reviews, show bias in favour of the utility companies. I am considering this option as there are enough of us to launch a mass action case. Very dissapointed in the unfair and biased outcome of my case.

OS failed to tell me that BG had responded (42 days lost). They say they don't do that - well they darn well ought to.2. I tendered a full complaint with copies of documents received from BG - they stood by BG in agreeing it had only ever been an 'estimate’, before admitting it was wrong by a factor of 3! They scoffed at Uswitch which had begged me and 18,000 other Breeze Energy customers to save ourselves £700. They refused to entertain a conversation I had with BG (over an hour) because BG said they had no record. Liars!2. I was offered the chance to appeal and I demanded someone else in OS reviewed my case. They don't do that and despite my appeal, the same individual stood her ground and told me her decision was final.3. After a short interval I received an email 28/08/2020 warning that I had 7 days to appeal the appeal! I did so 30/08/2020.

United Kingdom,2,1,25-May-20,5,2,2020,Complaint about BT,"I complained to Ombudsman Services (Communications) about BT failing to tell me that my fixed term contract would continue automatically after the expiry of the fixed term unless and until I gave 30 days' notice. The investigating officer Ms J claimed that her decision had ""taken into account all of the evidence which had been provided by both sides, along with industry standards, best practices, legislation and rules set by the regulator."" But her decision ignored all my evidence except that which supported BT. Also she made no reference to any of the ""industry standards etc"". Even when I asked what these were and how she had made use of them she only described what kind of information they can include. She did not identify the documents in which these standards are stated and how she had made use of them. The only standard Ms J had used was the common law of contract. Because a term was buried in BT's terms and conditions stating that the contract would continue automatically after the fixed term, and I had accepted BT's terms and conditions, it was my fault that I had failed to examine the terms and conditions in sufficient depth to discover this term. BT had made no reference to this term in the ""Confirmation of Order"" which it sent me. It mentioned many other trivial terms, but not this important term. It only provided a link to a page which gave 13 other links to documents, each several pages long, containing a terms and conditions for the various services which it provided. It was not clear which document(s) applied to my contract. I looked through each document and failed to find the term in question, even though I knew what I was looking for, until Ms J explained exactly where the term was located within the document.Ms J had stated that industry standards require the terms and conditions to be comprehensible and accessible. Trading Standards state that terms which are hidden in the contract are unfair. Ms J made no reference to Trading Standards and did not comment on the unfairness of the term.If the only standard which the ombudsman takes account of is contract law, as though BT and I are on an equal footing when negotiating the contract, and takes no account of consumer law nor Trading Standards, then it is a waste of time going to the Ombudsman. I would get a fairer, more comprehensive decision going directly to court. The Ombudsman Service is supposed to avoid the need to go to court.   I found a document from OfCom which appeared to say that BT was obliged to warn me that my contract would continue after the fixed term expired. I pointed this out to the investigating officer. She refused to comment on it but urged me to go ahead with my  appeal. I did so, criticising Ms J's biased decision. The appeal was determined by the same investigating officer Ms J!  She had reviewed her own decision and decided that she had not make any mistakes. The OfCom regulations which I found did not become legally binding on BT until after my contract term expired. How unhelpful of her not to mention that before I appealed.Appeal rejected.*******************************************************Reply to Comment by Ombudsman Services :The fact that there will always be an unhappy party does not excuse Ombudsman Services from being the cause of that unhappiness due to its biased methods.  As my case shows OS does not give equal weight to evidence from both parties. It only accepts evidence from the public which is corroborated by the service provider, and might ignore evidence which is corroborated if it does not support the decision the investigator has decided to make.In a fair investigation all of the main points on each side are acknowledged and addressed in a balanced manner, and reasons are given for rejecting any. I had provided evidence about the difficulty of contacting BT to inform it that bills were still being sent after the contract had ended; about the unfairness of a hidden term; about the admission by BT staff that BT used to warn customers that the contract would be extended automatically after the  end of the fixed term but had ceased doing so ""because customers didn't want it""; that BT claimed to be the industry leader when it came to customer service, but was failing to live up to standards which O2 maintained; and that BT had stated in writing in 2018 in response to an OfCom consultation that this practice should become mandatory in the industry.",Yes,27-May-20,"Hello, thank you for your review.

The most severe of which, is a duplicate account for the same meter, in the same house. The real account is fully up to date. The duplicate/false one has an outstanding amount of 5k ! The decision made by the Ombudsman was NOT, as to be expected, to have this duplicate account deleted. It was to come up with some estimated bill based on estimated usage, that will bring the bill down!!!I have declined their decision, of course. No choice.

United Kingdom,3,1,28-Dec-19,12,4,2019,The Energy Ombudsman Does NOT support the customer,"The person who was assigned to my case has the reasoning ability of a fruit fly and the conscience of a snake. British Gas was allowed to behave firstly stupidly and inefficiently in spite of me paying my direct debit every month. A stupid British Gas employee gave me a refund into my bank account which I did not ask for. Once I decided to switch to a different company British Gas decided to recoup the refund but not by simply asking me for it, but by making up bogus bills for a property I no longer resided at. It took me awhile to figure out why British Gas resurrected my old accounts from an old address and proceeded to tell a series of lies and persisted in generating bogus bills in spite of protestations and demonstrations of proof that I no longer lived there and that no one had moved in after me. When I went to the Energy Ombudsman to help with the matter because British Gas was not only incompetent in giving me back the massive refund I did not ask for, British Gas also acted unethically in trying to recoup the money. The latter didn't matter to the Ombudsman - it is fine for corporations to behave unethically in its view. The Ombudsman ruled against me and in favour of British Gas, when I asked the Ombudsman to also rule that British Gas should NOT add administration fees to recover the amount, the Ombudsman said it could not do that. There is no freaking justice for the common man/woman. So British Gas's folly put me in debt after I was made redundant and not able to repay the refund which they asked for 3 months after giving it to me. So not only was I plunged into debt at a vulnerable time in my life I was also have to pay back MORE money than I owe, because the Ombudsman think that it is ok for a billion pound company to take £50 extra plus the refund from an unemployed customer with an excellent record of payment than sending a message to an incompetent British Gas for whom £50 is 0.0000000000000000001% of what its CEO gets in end of year bonus than it is to ACTUAL seek justice for the consumer. Energy Ombudsman you should be ashamed of yourselves and your incompetent staff. i wish I had taken this to court because I feel a judge would have ruled with more compassion and commonsense than the Ombudsman. You are not fit for purpose. Do NOT use them is my advice. Go to court and represent yourselves.   PS. British Gas gave me back £60 for my troubles, but took £50 in recovery fees back from that £60 so the compensation I got for apparently ""allowing"" British Gas to refund me money into my account which I did not ask for is £10. A poor job Ombudsman - where is the justice for the common person. A corporation is allowed to make mistakes, if I made the mistake of not remembering to pay my bill how would that work out for me?

Emails supposedly can be sent to your case handler but are responded to by different people every time.I’ve been trying to get a credit refund of over £500 from Together Energy since February. I complained using the proper channels but was ignored, even by their CEO. Eventually went to the Energy Ombudsman in July who investigated and upheld my complaint. The compensation of £40 is derisory but, whatever. No interest applied to my credit balance which they agreed needed to be refunded. We’re now December and still no sign of a refund. I’ve complained to the Ombudsman now about their shoddy service but have yet to receive a response. Either way, I still don’t have MY money back from Together Energy.Keep getting fobbed off and told I need to provide up to date meter readings. I have done, numerous times. We finally got to a point where the precise refund amount was calculated and my bank details given to the energy provider to process a refund there and then. That was 3 weeks ago. I still don’t have it. Today... apparently I need to provide up to date readings.

We are a limited company and Director is my wife. And I have no relation with the company and the contract was under my name as a sole trader. Then I complained to the Ombudsman service, I pointed out that 1. On the recording this wad not my Voice, 2. We are a limited company we are not trading as a sole trader 3. In the business my wife is the director and lease is on her name. Without considering all those issues  after 8 weeks Ombudsman service informed me that the verbal contrac is a valid contract so eon will hold the contract. I declined their decision and I strongly believe that this Ombudsman service is working as a collaborator for the Energy supplier to legalese their illegal activities. They are useless and just waste of people's valuable  time.I will never suggest anyone to waste their time with these Useless and Backbonesless  people who can't take any independent decision apart from biased by Energy suppler. If anyone have any dispute  with energy supplier then they should to the court through their solicitor. And I strongly believe that you will get a remedy.

United Kingdom,8,1,30-Jul-19,7,3,2019,Just a glorified Customer Service Company and not a real Ombudsman Service,I have to completely agree with other reviews based on the ombudsman service they don't look at the case in front of them but rather side with the company even if no proof is provided on there behalf. I have since requested the telephone recordings with my conversation with the reps I was dealing with and I will be posting a review on YouTube on the service so others don't waste the same amount of time and energy that I did. I'm very disappointed that this company as it seems like a good idea but it's not geared around finding a fair resolution and it makes me really question the credentials of the people reviewing the cases itself. NOTE: I will be updating this when Video review is updated so you can see for yourself and hopefully save yourself some time and go with a more biased ombudsman service and while we are at it they should really change the company name to Multiple company customer service as this is what it is in a nutshell.I will soon find out if they follow the GDPR regulations and provide me with the call recordings I requested.,Yes,01-Aug-19,"Sorry to hear you've had a bad experience we always strive to reach a decision that is fair.For details of how to make a complaint about the service you've received from Ombudsman Services, please see our website: https://www.ombudsman-services.org/unhappy-with-our-service",2
United Kingdom,26,1,23-Jun-19,6,2,2019,Deadbeats,"Ombudsman Services upheld my complaint against EDF, but I rejected their ruling, appalled by the ineptitude with which they conducted their enquiry. The agent assigned to my case lacked the most elementary skills required for such a role, stubbornly favouring EDF’s feeble ‘dog-ate-my-homework’ excuses over the documentary evidence with which I provided her. When I contested her findings, she reassessed the evidence (I’m sure) – and concluded that she got it right the first time. That OS considers it acceptable practice for agents to review their own work tells you pretty much all you need to know about the seriousness with which it takes its responsibilities. The agent also made a serious factual error in claiming that energy companies aren’t required to provide their customers with customised information on cheapest tariffs. They are. This was confirmed by Ofgem, an organisation that, in marked contrast to OS, appears to take seriously its role of protecting consumer interests. They contacted OS to correct the error and order a new enquiry. A second agent assessing the same evidence, acknowledged mistakes – and reached the same conclusion as his colleague, simply reiterating EDF’s resolution: a standard letter of apology and £30.00 as gesture of good will. I told them what I thought of this. Clearly energy suppliers have nothing to fear from OS. Having screwed up, they simply make a derisory offer to make it go away, safe in the knowledge that it’ll be rubber-stamped by incurious OS staff. An averagely intelligent chimp could be trained to do such work, and would probably cost less than the monkeys who conducted my case. Anyone thinking of using OS should instead consider banging their head against a brick wall: You’ll get a headache just the same, but spare yourself a great deal of frustration. Better to just cut your losses and switch to a new supplier. Time spent dealing with these deadbeats is time wasted.UPDATEThank you for your reply, which amply demonstrates the complacency of which I speak. The lowest possible score on TrustPilot and an overwhelming vote of no confidence from users, and all you do is repeat the party line about your purported success rate, without once thinking that maybe you’re doing something wrong, something that it might just be within your means to improve. You’re fond of informing disappointed reviewers that a majority of OS outcomes favour the customer. I’ve viewed your latest annual report (2017? Seriously?), which includes a very basic overview of figures. If you’d like to make yourself useful and refute the charge of ‘deadbeat’ (time-server; a person or company not willing to accept responsibility CED), please tell me where I can view a comprehensive breakdown of these figures showing (a) how many of your rulings comply with the settlement offers made by energy companies and (b) how many exceed these offers.

I really hoped the Ombudsman could help but they told me their purpose is not to punish Toto and that they can't award compensation for literally hours wasted on hold to a company that never answers calls and against whom there are literally thousands of complaints which are all the same. Appalling customer service, unanswered calls, transfers stopped, repayments not made. I also found that in June last year Toto were warned to improve customer service by the ombudsman but even with thousands more complaints they don't appear to be doing anything to support vulnerable customers. Even when given a decision you can't really refuse it because if you do the case is closed. I felt forced to accept a small amount of compensation which wouldn't even buy a decent meal out and this has been after 90 months of hell battling to get an itemised bill for my 74 year old dad who has severe health problems and was threatened with court action (for money owed by other people), a man who has never owed anyone a penny in his life and who was deeply distressed.

United Kingdom,2,1,28-Nov-18,11,4,2018,A bizarre experience,"A bizarre experience. When complaining to BT they seemed very keen to refer the issue to the ombudsman. Having communicated with the ombudsmen for several months it is now apparent they are in place to protect companies like BT, rather than to be impartial as they state. Although the ombudsman eventually found in my favour, the penalty for BT was very small and a number of the ombudsman's replies were baffling to say the least. I highlighted several points of law I believed BT to be convening, with links to the relevant legislation .gov.uk pages to support the claim. Their response on a number of occasions seemed to be ""BT have their own procedures, we cannot really expect them to change this"". My argument being, if they are openly breaking the law, they should definitely be made to change their procedures and the only reason they are not is because ombudsman services are protecting them. The reply was ""well I am not legally trained so would not be prepared to comment on that.""  I would suggest that if their investigators are not legally trained but are shown some evidence of a company they mediate over is breaking the law, they may wish to pass the issue up to someone who is legally trained. However.... they ombudsman services also have their procedures and we cannot really expect them to change that, can we? No one to appeal, no one to complain to or give feedback to afterwards. A law upon themselves who (as they are not legally trained) allow their members to opperate outside of the law. Looking at the other feedback on here, the ombudsman needs an ombudsman to handle the number of issues people have with their (lack of) service.",Yes,30-Nov-18,"Hi James.

Within two weeks, Alison from the OS was mediating between us, communicating my frustration and arranging sensible steps for resolution.

A mistake was made re: meter reading by my 87 year old freind (who suffers macula degeneration eye didease) & consequently a ridiculously high bill was estimated. Although righted by Royston Flavel time & time again throughout the six months, the information was ignored. Ombudsman righted same. Must say however the credit of £75.00 did not even pay for the amount of phone calls made - found this disappointing.   Roy suffered very many sleepless nights worrying. E.On refused him a smart meter as he has a very old one. Offered him one lately with a wait of two months followed by lockdown!! Any fool when perusing the figures could easily spot that a meter reading mistake had taken place - an increased use of 500% is ludicrous hence the bill amounting to £800.00+ instead of £23.00 monthly DD was totally incorrect - it should never have taken six months to be righted by the Ombudsman.

United Kingdom,20,5,23-Jun-19,6,2,2019,"Simple, easy to use.","Their portal is great. Each side can upload their evidence and comments. It has been a very easy process to get going. I've not had a ruling on my case yet, so my comment is not biased at this point. But overall, it has made something I'm already annoyed having to do, much less stressful than it could be.Other comments on here about it being useless, well that's ADR for you in a nutshell. But it's still an unfair comment to make. It's only as powerful as both parties are willing to carry out their ruling. They rule and you're supposed to follow it, but you have to go further if the other party doesn't honour it - this is the fault of the party you're fighting, not the ombudsman. They can't compel you to obey their ruling. Often you may need to go further to force compliance. I don't think the reviews here are very justified.It exists to slow down/hopefully prevent people needing to go to court. Which is why it's usually a mandatory precursor to a court case. If people aren't complying with your ADR ruling, then file a case at court. That's your next step. ADR just make decisions that people should honour, they have no power to force compliance. That's for a court. You can't mark them down for that.For the record, I'm fighting Origin Broadband, not an energy company.Update: I didn't win my case but I still enjoyed using their service.

Finally they stopped replying to my contacts and I escalated the case to the Ombudsman Service. From my first contact I was treated with respect and I was listened to. Their service was explained carefully to me, the time scales involved and the fact that they wanted to find a fair resolution for both sides.   I had to gather and provide my own evidence, this was logged into my account. I could ask questions and receive quick answers from the service throughout. I did not accept Bulb’s first proposal, it was not fair and they would not share the monetary value of their offer, so I felt “in the dark”.

Six months later despite several contacts and complaints, I'd still not heard anything from them, or had my outstanding balance returned.I raised a case with the Ombudsman. He got an immediate reply where they had ignored me, and I received a small credit from the supplier. I also got a mass of reasons why it was only a tenth of what I thought they owed me.The Ombudsman unravelled all their BS which actually turned out to be correct, but he pressed the case and I received a letter of apology (yeah right) and a compensation payment (much better) for the dismal service.Despite the energy company previously helping themselves to my bank account via DD, they provided the compensation in the form of a cheque, which of course made it as difficult as possible to credit to my account (most bank branches now being closed). This last century response might explain the last century service I received from my former supplier, but it cut no ice with the Ombudsman, who sailed through and got me a superb result.Fully recommended if you have problems with these 'holier than thou' energy behemoths.",Yes,18-Jul-22,"We are glad to hear that you were satisfied with the outcome of your dispute, Robert!

He further on went to make statements like 'you benefited from it','you can seek financial support from charities' and ' I will advice if the new bill is fair'. He isn't even trying to hold OVO responsible for misinformation, mismanagement of my account and lack of communication of the technical error or state of my account. We are talking about an error that lasted over 18 months on my account and they don't want to take any responsibility for it but rather want me to pay the price for it.",Yes,08-Aug-24,"Hello, we're sorry that you haven't had a positive experience when using our services and we understand that it may be frustrating when you don't get the outcome that you we're hoping for.

They are bias and have too much interest in protecting the energy companies (they possibly have shares in these companies). My complaint was not investigated fairly and they did not address not even one of the concerns I raised, and they quite blatantly backed the energy company even when the energy company admitted they were at fault and wanted to issue an apology to me. So this blatant one sidedness shown from The Energy Ombudsman was very shocking. The investigator was rude and when asked questions about his decision he just dismissed me, and told me rudely to either press Accept or Decline. The Energy Ombudsman is biased and does not conduct fair and impartial investigations. Extremely disappointed. The investigators decision put me in a really bad position, that I was forced to accept or I would have ended up in a worse position than when I presented my case to The Energy Ombudsman.

United Kingdom,16,1,17-Jun-24,6,2,2024,The decision maker ignored the breaches…,"The decision maker ignored the breaches in regulations by the energy company. They had only given 6 days notice to change the direct debit - it should have been 10 days, he did not adjudicate on this? The energy company told him the bill is being produced on 1st of each month - none have been, ever? I sent the bill produced during his ‘investigation’ it was dated 11th! He would not challenge them on their lie? The latest bill just received is also dated 11th?! The decision maker did not send a summary prior to his decision - but, this was detailed as part of their process?He would not answer my enquires regarding any of these remaining issues? Parroting “We are unable to change policy or procedure?” Both my issues are regulation and law, not, company policy or procedure?I have tried 3 times to get my case reviewed - each time I am referred back to Allan the ‘decision maker!’I find it incredible that a decision in my favour does not change my position going forward. The energy company is still stealing £23 per month from my bank account it has no entitlement to do so - because they breached the direct debit mandate. He ‘recommends’ they reduce the direct debit back down - but doesn’t hold them to account for the breach? They lied regarding the date they produce my bills, and continue to produce it on 11th of the month. Which means they don’t post it until after the 11th - but we still don’t know when they post it? I don’t get the bill until the 3rd week of the month - if I’m lucky! The online complaint about Ombudsman Services doesn’t work!??Complete waste of time and money despite finding in my favour! I detailed “I don’t want compensation - I do want the money back they are stealing from my bank account.” This was ignored - but compensation ordered for “Customer Service Failings.” It’s completely baffling!",Yes,20-Jun-24,"Hello, we're sorry that you haven't had a positive experience when using our services.

United Kingdom,15,1,07-May-24,5,2,2024,"Energy ombudsman need investigating, abysmal service","Contacted the energy ombudsman about ongoing issues with british gas which i had been trying to resolve for months. The ombudsman cannot create a case until eight weeks after you have raised an official complaint with the company concerned. Absolutely absurd.The case as to be dealt with online via a portal that was difficult to use unless you are computer savvy so not ideal for everyone. The case handler did speak to me by phone to try and help, however their phone line was abysmal and i could barely understand a word they said so relaying information was virtually impossible. Months have passed and the handlers phone line is exactly the same.How can someone get paid to do a job supposedly to be helping the public when they cannot even be heard on the telephone. Several more weeks passed, the case handler reached a decision in my favour that i wasn't particularly happy with but couldn't cope with any more time wasting from neither british gas or the ombudsman. A date was set by which british gas should have implemented the decision that the case handler made. I was receiving letters/emails from british gas but nothing to do with the resolution. I emailed and rang the case handler raising concerns that British gas still did not have a clue what they were doing and that i wasn't confident that they would actually resolve things as instructed. I was advised i had to wait until the date set before anything could be done.As i predicted the date as passed and british gas did not abide by the case makers decision. I telephoned and emailed the case handler to inform them on 29th April 2024. Their voicemail says they will respond within 24hrs. No surprise i am still waiting. I spent hours on the telephone to british gas last week to no avail. Promised call backs which havn't happened. As for the ombudsman i don't know whether the staff are just pig ignorant with regards to returning calls or clearly just not interested as they get paid regardless!The ombudsman is as equally incompetent as british gas with little regard for the consumer and actually need investigating themselves.

United Kingdom,6,1,25-Mar-24,3,1,2024,Disgraceful,The ombudsman explained that they have no regard to illegalities  practised by the energy companies.

The problem is if the energy company decides to totally ignore the ombudsman there is absolutely nothing they can do; no financial penalties, no reporting to Ofgem.So after spending hours of my life contacting OVO and the ombudsman I still have a problem; something that would literally take 20 minutes to resolve. UpdateAfter posting my review I had a reply from the ombudsman. The thing is I have contacted them on numerous occasions and they simply say we will ask the supplier for an update. As I said above the ombudsman do not have any power to force energy companies to follow their instructions.",Yes,28-Mar-24,Hello.

United Kingdom,1,1,20-Feb-24,2,1,2024,How to deal with failings of Ombudsman,"Advice for consumers who have had their complaints ignored by the Ombudsman, or the Ombudsman has failed to complete the complaint process or has  just simply ignored you. Write a polite letter to your MP seeking help. Your MP cannot force the Ombudsman to act, but the Ombudsman is obliged to respond to an MP. This will have the effect of highlighting the Ombudsman's failings as it will have to come up with some feeble excuse for ignoring your justified complaint.  If enough people raise a complaint with their MP about the failings of the Ombudsman, the message may just get home ie that the Energy Ombudsman is not fit for purpose. Hope this advice helps.",Yes,23-Feb-24,"Hi, we're sorry that you haven't had a positive experience when using our services.

United Kingdom,12,1,16-Feb-24,2,1,2024,I hope you understand their limitations...,"Six complaints since 2021 and this is their final response...Your complaint has been passed to me to look in to following your complaint about our service. I am so very sorry that the issues have been ongoing for some time. You being caught between two suppliers isn't ideal either and I can appreciate how upsetting and stressful this must be.I can see Scottish Power advised us that OVO Energy rejected the ET they proposed, I am also aware that OVO Energy have somehow told you that it wasn't them that rejected this. It can be hard when we have two suppliers saying the other is to blame, I called OVO Energy personally to ask them about this, I was told that on 24 April 2023 OVO Energy received a data flow - this is how the industry communications are described as it is all done electronically - to accept the return of the supply from Scottish Power, as such I would be satisfied that Scottish Power did try to do what we asked, no matter their errors in the past, this was definitely actioned. OVO Energy confirmed to me that in December 2023 this action was closed off, it was closed off without completing the action, although by that point there would have been no possibility of the ET being completed as it was over 2 years since the original ET in May 2021, had OVO Energy actioned this sooner after receiving it on 23 April 2023, the possibility was high that the supply would have returned.The unfortunate thing here is as the supply remained with Scottish Power and didn't return to OVO Energy like we had all wanted, any and all charges are valid and payable to Scottish Power, I do appreciate you will not welcome this news, and sadly they will continue to prevent you from leaving them if there is no payment plan in place (sometimes they can prevent you leaving even when there is one in place) this is permitted within the industry which again I understand will be disappointing for you, but there is little we can do about how the industry works. This means that Octopus Energy have been prevented from taking your supply, which I can see was due to start with them on 16 February 2024. I am sorry that no one picked up on the messages you were sending on this case sooner, we have since had an overhaul on how we work, this means that the remedies are much more closely monitored now, I appreciate that doesn't help you, but these are improvements we have made based on lessons learned from cases similar to yours. It does mean that however, there is very little else we can do for you on this complaint, Scottish Power did do what was agreed, but sadly their control over what happened was limited and while I appreciate OVO Energy have given you a different version of events in writing, the conclusion drawn during my call today is they were at fault for not completing the requirement and as a result of those delays, the possibility of having the supply returned is no longer a viable option. I am really sorry I am not coming to you with better news, especially due to this additional complaint, however, I hope you will understand my limitations.Further update......So turns out quickest way to resolve energy complaints is by leaving negative online reviews with each supplier as this has resulted in my complaints being dealt with in 1 week rather then the 3 years it took the Ombudsman.Another update...Complained to Trust Alliance Group about my experience and told someone would contact me by 8th March to discuss this.... one week later still heard nothing.Final update.. Turns out Trust Alliance Group are just a different department within the Ombudsman so you can imagine how that complaint worked out for me. However, they did clarify why they can get away with what they have done and that's because since the end of 2022 they don't have to pay compensation for complaints they fail to deal with.So to summarise their service, you raise a complaint and they get paid by the supplier. Then they dilly dally for around 12 months before telling you there's no more they can do.",Yes,19-Feb-24,"Hi Josh, we're sorry that you haven't had a positive experience when using our services.

United Kingdom,18,1,03-Feb-24,2,1,2024,No such thing as consumer protection,"I contacted the Energy Ombudsman (EO) because it took Scottish Power (SP) 11 months to address a dispute. During this time, SP harassed and bullied me, failed to comply with the Equality Act 2010, failed to make reasonable adjustments and discriminated against me. The EO platform is hard to access (emailed links don't work), extremely difficult to navigate, and very hard to use. I imagine this would be the case for every user, not just those with cognitive impairments. Don't be fooled into thinking the EO is there to 'police' the behaviour of energy suppliers or to ensure consumer protection - they condone bad behaviour and fail to give energy giants guidance, so their remit is not what I thought at all. I am sure this is my misunderstanding, but I think most of us would have different expectations of what the EO do and what their responsibilities are. A tiny part of my case was resolved to a small degree - the rest I will have to take up through the Courts.",Yes,06-Feb-24,"Hi there, we're sorry to hear that you found our case management system difficult to use - this is something we are working to continually improve so we appreciate customer feedback such as this.

United Kingdom,9,1,22-Jan-24,1,1,2024,The energy ombudsman are corrupt,"I tired to make a complaint to The Energy Ombudsman about Eon Next and they categorically wouldn't take it, they kept changing it.  I am disabled, it is bad enough being ripped off by the electricity company but wasting 50 mins on the phone is horrendous! I was patronised by a girl called Leanne. I told her all the points why I should legally get the warm winter discount. My complaint was  that Eon Next won't give it to me (and there are 5 pieces of evidence) I asked the girl to read the complaint  back to me and she couldn't. She couldn't because she hadn't taken it down. When you lie you can't remember. I rang back to get the complaint done properly (you can't do a complaint or win without EVIDENCE) The next  man done exactly the same thing. Boris Johnson got rid of all legislation. Everyone is corrupt now. I put a complaint into the ombudsman before when the same thing happened. They never got back to me.  When you tell people you are disabled they think you are stupid. Injuries, disabilities etc do not equate to lack of intelligence. It is a basic lack of education and training. It denotes prejudice and discrimination. I get this all the time. No-one takes any notice of the discrimination laws. It is direct discrimination (The Equality Act 2010) LGBT and other groups in society are taken care of but not the disabled. I got abused yesterday when I parked. Apparently, I don't fit the mould. It is unacceptable, inhumane and fundamentally unlawful. Just for the record, I am on the highest  rate of mobility and the highest rate of daily living allowance, I live alone, I get under £19,000, I take a lot of medication and I am on the vulnerable list. Eon Next knows this The Energy Ombudsman knows this but neither of them will do 'The Job Description'. Thank's. I am adding to this review  on the 29th of January.  You may think the above review, as all my reviews may be a diatribe of neuroses.  They sound it when reading them back. It's all about the law.  It's just about the law. There is no law anymore.  No legislation, no legal aid, no ombudsman (s) plural for anyone to fall back on. The pretence is there but it's hollow.

I didn't want to believe it, so I went ahead and filed my complaint. an energy company made a huge mistake by not charging me for energy for two years. They only found out about this when I called and told them they made a mistake. They then decided to backdate the bill and ask for £500 a month for an error they made but expect me to fix. I then filed a complaint with the Ombudsman, stating that this is the main issue and that if they cannot resolve it, I will not agree to these terms. I was told that if they did not agree, I would win the case. After weeks of waiting, the energy company could not fulfil the agreement even apologies that they could not, but Ombudsman decided to close the case and say it was resolved because they offered me a payment plan before I went to Ombudsman, and after trying to explain to the Ombudsman that they hadn't and providing evidence, I kept getting told sorry we cannot get involved as it's a company decision. When I asked why my case was closed, I was told that the payment plan of £500 that was offered to me prior to my complaint counts as a remedy, which is absurd because that is why I filed the complaint in the first place. It appears that I am being ignored and that they are collaborating with businesses.

Contacted the ombudsman as clearly OVO raised our tariff without informing us or communicating with us and we’re being harassed for more money. Ombudsman got fixated on the fact the meter readings ‘were correct’ but refused to investigate or acknowledge the extortionate raise in price. Just kept claiming the bills were correct and reflected the time of year being winter. I was told on 3 separate occasions from OVO that the account was on hold while first they investigated and then while the ombudsman investigated however it never was and they sent us to collections, which the ombudsman never addressed. I requested transcripts and a deadlock letter from OVO and never received them, this was never addressed by the ombudsman.The mental stress and turmoil this has caused me was never addressed by the ombudsman.

United Kingdom,9,1,01-Sep-23,9,3,2023,Ombudsman manager not willing to put any pressure on Scottish Power. In spite of ruling in my favour.,"The ombudsman ruled in my favour against Scottish Power in October 2021 about energy mis-billing in June July and August 2021 for energy consumed between March 2019 and March 2020, when I switched to another supplier.  However in my view they deliberately overlooked the key point. Scottish Power had abused the back-billing rule of 2018, such that even if the bill in  June 2021 was wrong or right, it was for energy consumed more than twelve months previously, that had never been billed for previously (when I closed the account the final bill of April 2020 show my account in credit). Due to the passage of time therefore, Scottish Power were breaking the law by sending me a new bill asking for £850, having told me over a year earlier I owed them nothing.  So rather than simply adjudicate on this very simple back-billing matter, the ombudsman fudged it. It asked Scottish Power to generate a new bill with correct readings on it, to send me a letter of apology, and to offer me a whopping £50 as a gesture of goodwill. Naturally, i appealed the decision yet they maintained the original decision. This was in November 2021. The ombudsman had all the evidence they needed (I had uploaded every bit of evidence they could possibly have wanted), they ruled in my favour but should have concluded that I did not owe Scottish Power any money. They recognised Scottish Power had billed me wrongly and that their customer service was poor. But maybe because the energy companies are their ultimate paymasters, they curiously omitted to acknowledge the blindingly obvious back-billing attempt. The rejection of my appeal took place on  1 November 2021. I received a message on that date from Paul Darlington saying I would need to decide whether to accept their original decision, but crucially he gave me no timeline by which I had to make any such decision.  Obviously I wasn't happy about his rejection of my appeal, but figured that the back-billing rule would still apply if they were to produce a new bill, since it would be even more out of date I ran this past Mr Darlington and he responded in ""tech speak"", neither confirming or denying that a new bill would also be a back-billing issue. Pure obfuscation in my view. But given my situation in November 2021, only an idiot would have rejected the original decision (as later claimed by Scottish Power). In the event, life moved on and I neither accepted or rejected the decision in 2021. Roll the clock forward nearly two years to June 2023 and suddenly LCS debt collectors are hounding me on behalf of Scottish Power for said ""unpaid"" bill of 2019/20. I went straight back to the ombudsman - ""oh, you never accepted our decision"" - so I messaged them there and then, stating that I was accepting their original decision and asked for an acknowledgment. A month later the message still hadn't be responded to so in August 2023 I call them again, threatening to make a complaint. To cut a long story short, Paul Darlington finally responded, full of apologies, saying that it should have been clear that I had 14 days to decide from 1 November 2021 on whether to accept the original decision. I suggested to him that this information was never shared with me, and asked to be shown any evidence he might have to the contrary. I told him that Scottish Power were now claiming that i had rejected his decision. No credible evidence was forthcoming. So I chose to escalate. Shortly thereafter I got a call from Owen Merrick, a dispute resolution coach, who apologised that a senior manager wasn't available. He then after hearing my multiple grievances proceeded to argue that I had rejected the appeal decision (as also claimed by Scottish Power) and that he had computer evidence to prove it. I explained that only an idiot would have not accepted a ruling that was largely in their favour, given the rejected appeal. He was adamant he was right: ""the computer says no!"". His screenshot shows that on 1 November 2021 Paul Darlington rejected my appeal. It also shows that I viewed the decision online a few minutes later. What it  does not prove is that I knowingly rejected the original decision.No acknowledgement or confirmation email of my so call rejection was ever sent to me.Had the case been clear-cut rejection issue as Mr Merrick had argued over the phone, why did Paul Darlington, the case manager , not mentioned this to me at any other time, rather than only writing about a 14-day deadline??Merrick's call was last week - he has so far ignored my messages - I suspect he will dig his heels in and continue to argue black is white.

United Kingdom,1,1,22-Aug-23,8,3,2023,Rasing a complaint to the Energy Ombudsman was a complete waste of time,"(Rating should be ZERO but option not available)Rasing a complaint to the Energy Ombudsman was a complete waste of time. I raised a compliant with regards to EDF refusing to test and replace faulty smart meter which had been reported with an issue after about 2 weeks of it being installed. Every though I have repeatedly contacted and requested that EDF test and replace the smart meters which they have failed to do. The Energy Ombudsman case handler has closed my complaint as resolved when EDF have not done anything at all to test/check or replace the reported faulty Smart meters. EDF sent a resolution letter which detailed an appointment booking and then declared in same letter that my complaint has been closed. (This is before the appointment date or visited my property or resolving issues with my reported faulty smart meters)I find it hard to believe that service being offered by the Energy Ombudsman to be impartial when EDF’s letter can be accepted when nothing has been done by them. I have instead been advised/told by the case handler to contact the same EDF customer services (that ignored my request) that I have contacted repeatably before without getting listen too, to again request for my Smart Meter to be tested because the allegedly impartial Energy Ombudsman cannot instruct an Energy provider to test its installed reported faulty Smart Meters. Also, if I fully understanding the response letter from the Case Handler, the Energy Ombudsman cannot even instruct the Energy provider (complaint team) to contact the customer directly to receive or accept request to pay fee to get faulty smart meter tested.I am sad to report that I believe I have somehow been discriminated against as surely service received cannot be the impartial service reportedly on offer from the Energy Ombudsman.",Yes,25-Aug-23,"Hello, we're sorry to hear that you have not had a positive experience when using our services.

United Kingdom,3,1,07-Jul-23,7,3,2023,Rolling Over,"Initially the complaint was handled well. Although I was not fully in agreement with the decision made it seemed a reasonable compromise. The main part of that decision was to instruct Scottish Power (SP) to rebill the disputed period from 6 September 2019 up to 10 April 2023 when a smart meter was installed based on an EAC of 830kwh for the day and 1,224kwh for the night. I was subsequently advised by your officer that ""After a very long phone call with them on 23 June 2023 it was established that it was not possible to re-bill the account as I had requested, this was primarily due to the incorrect DMEX that they had completed with the added complication of an actual meter exchange. This meant that they could not withdraw all of the billing and could only manipulate the meter readings to get the account to bill."" You then accepted the SP position despite their bill containing wild estimates and my pointing out that in the 3 year period from 6 September 2019 to 7 September 2022 they had charged a total consumption of 3 times the combined EAC figures they were supposed to use. The effect is a serious overcharge on the account which my relative is now obliged to pay. Whatever reason SP came up with to suggest they could not rebill the account does not hold water. They knew the various time periods between tariff changes and the total annual consumption they were to bill so it would be a relatively simple mathematical exercise to calculate the overcharge manually and apply a credit to the account.I have since tried to contact both the case officer and also your main email contact address in an attempt to have the situation reviewed or at least for you to telephone me to discuss this but have had no response.

United Kingdom,2,1,04-Jul-23,7,3,2023,Ombudsman Services Fails in Duty and Transparency,"My experience with the Ombudsman Services has been deeply unsatisfactory due to their poor handling of an escalated complaint involving EDF Energy. The service exhibited a regrettable lack of scrutiny, disregard for essential evidence, and a refusal to reevaluate their decision even when new evidence emerged.My complaint concerned a large, unjust charge by EDF Energy. The Ombudsman Services, despite regulations that call for transparent billing, failed to ensure EDF provided a clear and comprehensive breakdown of these charges.Additionally, the Ombudsman Services neglected crucial evidence that indicated I was not liable for these charges. Instead, they accepted EDF's baseless assertions without further investigation. This oversight has resulted in an unjust financial burden on me, owing to a decision based on an inaccurate understanding of the circumstances.Further compounding this is the Ombudsman Services' insensitivity towards my personal family circumstances, which added unnecessary distress to an already challenging situation. Their refusal to reconsider the initial decision in the light of new evidence surfaced starkly contradicts their own guidelines.Their handling of my case has led to a failure in upholding their duty of ensuring fair practice and transparency. Their neglect has allowed the persistence of unjust charges from EDF and the continued threat of unwarranted financial burdens.In conclusion, I am gravely disappointed with the Ombudsman Services. As a body tasked with safeguarding consumer rights, their disregard for due process and fair treatment is both concerning and disheartening.

These incompetent slugs still have not contacted me over the complaint I placed about their service over a month ago. So much for their lying comment. They deserve to be fired as they do not help anyone.This is purely for the energy ombudsman. These people are rude and incompetent. British Gas cut off my gas supply hence me having to deal with the ombudsman. The ombudsman decided I was too stupid and they believe that I thought I was on a credit meter when I was on a prepayment. What?????????Really??????? Appealed and supplied evidence. 30 mins of ""investigating"" later, the decision was upheld because British Gas said they didn't do it. I supplied evidence my network operator didn't and had call recordings. Not that these beings even bothered to listen. They also left some of my complaints out and didn't even acknowledge them. How incompetent and even more for the manager who spent a massive 30 mins on my appeal. This ""manager"" also did not have the decency to call which I had requested. So incompetent and rude. My problem has been going on since the end of August and now still will not end. Even though they trusted British Gas, they didn't once consider the fact I have recordings of them lying to me and promising me free gas. These incompetent people do not deserve this job.They have prolonged my complaint, not investigated and wasted my time. This has all caused me extra stress. Time to take this to the paper and MP's. Even more disgusting that British Gas' disgusting practices were exposed, and now I find out that the ombudsman allow these disgusting practices by ignoring the complaints. So disgusted and insulted. These beings need investigating too, along with British Gas. Both are corrupt and just look after themselves. I have placed a complaint but apart from going to court, there is no other option to fight these cowboys. These beings need to answer to someone. They certainly do not help people who need it. But they are paid for by the energy companies so I shouldn't be surprised. Foul service2 weeks plus days later of placing a complaint, and no response. I'm guessing they're like British gas and I'll hear something 6 plus weeks later.March 3rd and no one has contacted me about my complaint. Will have to go to my MP. These people are beyond useless.

I went to the ombudsman with clear evidence that BG had deleted the phone call where the mis-selling took place (at least BG had the good grace to admit that in writing) and couldn't even get the name of the fixed price deal I was on correct. On that basis alone the ombudsman should have upheld my complaint, but instead quivered about being an evidence based service (despite clear evidence of phone calls being erased). A complete waste of time and the most pointless, toothless and useless service.Response to the Ombudsman reply:Whilst I appreciate you are an evidence based service, there is such a thing as credibility when it comes to the law and deciding the outcome of disputes, particularly in civil cases. British Gas admitted (in writing) they deleted the recording of the telephone conversation where they offered me the terms of the fixed tariff and yet you seem completely unable to consider this and their credibility as a result. Your only response to that was that I had to somehow obtain a recording of the conversation from almost a year ago ! Ridiculous. They claim they sent the terms of the tariff in a letter to me, they didn't. They have clearly told you they issued me with an 8 week letter. That is false as well. They are in the news today with widespread public anger and OFGEM intervention concerning their practices of fitting pre-payment meters and yet you are unable to consider their credibility.

United Kingdom,25,1,10-Oct-22,10,4,2022,"You may win, but the Ombudsman will let the energy company decide the remuneration.","Before I get started, don't make the same mistake I did. At time of writing the OS has 2 stars on Google and 3.2 stars here. A lot of the complaints seem to be that the Ombudsman may side with you, but will just award you what the energy company already has suggested. Basically, siding with you but not really against the company. I thought, probably just sour grapes... Oh how wrong I was. Just seek citizens advice help and maybe a legal consult, avoid the OS. Just my advice.Now, following my communications being described as vexatious by a senior OS Investigator, I'll stick to the facts here.Fact 1) My complaint of 5 parts, spanning over more than 6 months and including threatening letters and failure to comply with GDPR, was upheld on 4 parts due to a technicality and the 5th part (GDPR issue) was upheld by the ICO in the end. So, OS found in my favour.Fact 2) The award by the OS was exactly the same as the award provided by my energy provider when the original complaint broke down.Fact 3) If I had allowed Back Bill to take effect I would have potentially claimed months of energy usage off my bill (greater than the award offered by the OS).Fact 4) I was forced to accept my claim due to the Senior Investigator going silent over the deadline and, as I responded to his message within the day, the failure to read or act on my message is to blame. Fact 5) The OS refused to provide a clear and objective way they reached the same value as the energy company.Fact 6) When I contested the original resolution with evidence that I felt they had not followed their own Time and Trouble policy, the contest was refused for supplying no additional evidence.Fact 7) When the failure of the OS Investigator to acknowledge my evidence was clear I asked for a senior to take a look (and this is when things got worse).Fact 8) Without putting the case on hold the Senior Investigator responded with 6 days left to accept the resolution. I responded the very same day.Fact 9) The Senior Investigator then failed to respond to any followup communications until the working day after I had accepted the resolution (reluctantly).Fact 10) In his belittling response, the Senior Investigator disputed my claim that they have not correctly audited my complain... In a paragraph right after a line where he outlines how they have just fixed my case as something wasn't audited right.Fact 11) The Senior Investigator then preceded to belittle me further and claim that I was making ""unreasonable demands and refusal to accept [sic]our processes."" If the OS are indeed independent, which I'm not claiming they are not, then there should be nothing unreasonable about asking for a clear and objective measure used to calculate remuneration... Especially when they are suspiciously equal to what the energy company already offered.Fact 12) The Senior Investigator decided to belittle me further claiming I had been vexatious in my approach to questioning their impartiality. Which I dispute.Fact 13) And he preceded to throw the ""Unacceptable Actions Policy"" at me citing how the OS can now ignore messages they see as going against that policy. Fact 14) Had the OS actually outlined how the equal amount was calculated I would have, reasonably, accepted the response. (Say, £50 for this, £50 for that... etc). The OS's refusal to provide any objective justification is more unreasonable than asking for it.Fact 15) One of the justifications for the Senior Investigator to call me ""unreasonable"" is the repeated claim that I was asking for the divulging of internal materiel or tools. I was never asking for that. My messages were clear. I was only looking for the calculation used or the objective points and values used to come to my award.Fact 16) The Senior Investigator clearly claims they have not sided with the energy provider meaning they have chosen to forfeit the line ""where we agree with a financial offer by the supplier we will maintain this"" and have somehow come to the same value as the supplier in a different way. All I've ever asked for is proof that an objective measure was taken... Something the OS have refused and failed to give.What I have found is that the OS do not want to be questioned at all. If there was no fear around impartiality then I wouldn't be being silenced and ignored by the OS and I find the Senior Investigators response, which he signed off with ""I trust this politely clarifies our position"" to be anything but polite. I will never be using the OS (energy) again, I've made a complaint to OFGEM and my MP as there clearly is something broken in the system.For those asking. Vexatious means to cause or tend to cause annoyance, frustration, or worry.If questioning the fairness and impartiality of a decision can cause or tend to cause annoyance, frustration, or worry... then that is worrying.",Yes,13-Oct-22,"Hi William, thank you for taking the time to leave your review, and for the detailed information you provided.

I accepted just so I could have an end to the whole situation but Ovo energy came up with every excuse not to comply and when I contacted the agent by phone to discuss, she was so rude, kept interrupting me to defend the energy company, argued about facts and then told me to stop shouting at her even though she had spoken down to me throughout the whole conversation. I asked for a call from her line manager and this was never received.

They knew that the last direct debit hike was to to be £186 pm with no means to lower that and her last 3 months gas and electric bills combined averaged approx £60 per month!!! They only upheld the side of the compliant relating to the companies poor timescale response and chose not to increase the companies rejected offer pre this Ombudsman complaint. It is still worth taking up a unresolved complaint with an Energy company with the Ombudsman as the energy company picks the tab of the cost of the complaint whether they win or lose.

All I wanted was a smart meter from SSE and as the government keep pushing rising energy costs and we all need to monitor usage very closely I thought the ombudsman would help.  They just agreed with energy company on every issue - I assumed they would be on the side of the government on helping to conserve energy but completely hopeless.

Your investigations officer has issued you a decision as to why your energy company has not yet been able to provide you with a smart meter. There are certain elements of metering that are the homeowners responsibility and if there is an issue with any of these components then the homeowner would need to address this before the supplier is able to fit the meter.

I send on copies to the Ombudsman, they tell us what SSE tells them, the saga continues.  It seems that the Ombudsman has no authority to impose an agreed solution on SSE.

Instead, the ‘little’ person did not get their voice heard. I won both cases but way it was handled was unacceptable. It dragged on for years unnecessarily often because their knowledge was poor and I was having to provide my own evidence from experts in detail.

Myself and 02 provided all the requested evidence( 02s actually backed me up that I have never used this amount in a month let alone 6hrs asleep). Ombudsman very slow and found in 02’s favour and stated that data allocation/collation is specific to the sim and impossible to be wrong. Due to slowness I had another billing period that again was a data error on my account this time 02 gave me double data. Raised this with 02 they investigated manager called me back to advise they don’t know why and it is an error at there end(admitted on recorded call). Reported this to the ombudsman and was advised submit the new evidence and they would re-look at the case. Did this provided photo evidence, 02 had recorded calls and I made them aware at the time of the error and during 02s investigation. Weeks go by to get a email saying nothing is change no evidence as been made to the ombudsman, challenged this as there are numerous emails, photos and recorded calls, to get ombudsman flat out refusal to do anything and just state that data allocation and collation is impossible to be wrong as checked by independent engineers. Surely photos, correspondence and calls from the company admitting they are fault is more evidence than can possibly be needed but no the ombudsman even after 02s admittance there is an error over rule them and state no error and basically it’s tough take them to court.

Verry matter of fact ly telling me that the company has ceased to trade and they can no longer persue my claim. This is despite the ombudsmen decision being made 2 months ago, me highliting in the allotted time that the payment had not been made and zero action being taken by the ombudsman. They are not here to help the public. If a large company takes advantage you have zero recourse as a customer. Update: since the Energy ombudsmen have replied to this review so swiftly I contacted them again and have received no reply. This drives home the point that they are wanting to appear as if they are doing something about the matter but as of updating this post I have received no communications from the ombudsmen. I contacted the Energy Ombudsmen a few months ago to raise an issue I have had with the energy supplier Symbio. After supplying my evidence and proving my case the ombudsmen then deliberated for a few weeks and issued their remedy due to Symbio being in violation of a few laws. the final remedy was to take place on the 07/08/2021.After 14 working days I had not received the compensation decided by the ombudsmen and agreed to by Symbio. I then contacted the Ombudsmen who said they would look into the issue.Almost 2 months after the decision and countless emails of me following up with the ombudsmen and still I have not received the compensation agreed upon.As of today I have discovered that Symbio will cease to trade meaning I will probably not receive the compensation and once again my time has been wasted.When large companies abuse their power the only recourse customers have are the ombudsmen and in this case, they have failed. I have followed up and have given ample warning that Symbio have not abided by the decision and yet nothing was done and I received basic copy paste answers from the ombudsmen.Contacting the energy ombudsmen will do nothing for you so don't waste your time.",Yes,04-Oct-21,"Hi Bob, We are sorry to hear about your circumstances.

They looked at all the evidence and I really don't think I had made my case clear enough.  I should have sought advice from a solicitor or Citizens Advice.  They made some recommendations on how to use Zoom, etc. Not helpful, bit of a cheek.  Impossible for me to use the BT broadband for coursework as it is too unreliable, cant even upload a photograph most times.  I have resorted to using a Vodaphone dongle, which works very well.  The Ombudsman Service just a waste of my time and left me feeling more angry than when I started.

Given EDF billed me based on their OWN estimates for the first two months at a 'reasonable' amount surely highlights something.. not to mention the fact there are THREE faults on the meter which they did not repair... but yes you are right, must be all us customers who are wrong.

United Kingdom,7,1,10-Jul-21,7,3,2021,Appalling,"Appalling. In my case the investigator rang me to discuss the dispute with my energy supplier (Symbio) and the figure of £250 was mentioned as what I was due to pay not the £1.4k claimed by the energy supplier's estimate (I live alone and my small flat is rated at £679 per annum and I'd already paid that twice over). Because I was naïve I readily accepted the investigator's judgement. However, when the final decision was made and the report published the £250 figure was dropped. The investigator says Symbio have said that they have implemented the decision but to date I have not been contacted by phone, email, text or letter by Symbio at all. In addition to this  Symbio are suing me in the small claims court for £1.4k which doesn't even match their last bill to me which is less. Despite finding in my favour on all four billing and service response counts the ombudsman says the case is now resolved and closed, without even checking with me that Symbio have done what they say they would or even waiting for the 14 day implementation period to to expire. The ombudsman is toothless to do anything about the court case and refuses to get involved. All this after nearly two and a half years of problems with Symbio.

I very quickly informed them of their errors but all I get back is to be told to wait another 14 days by one OS staff member, AND to wait another 28 days by a different staff member, they make it up as they go, how professional??Whilst I ""wait"" I have been going through all of this huge pile of ""BAD"" reviews and it makes for very depressing reading.  I find the OS responses to these bad reviews to be very sad.  They all follow the same condescending tone and repetitive script with its own level of patronising ""how sorry we are"" etc etc versions that makes it so obvious that the OS staff member could not really care a jot.  It leads me to wonder how on earth they can work for an organisation like this and still be able to look at themselves each morning as they go to work, very sad.As others have said, and I agree, it must be time for some Government body, not OfGem, they are just as bad, but a few MPs with a conscience that take the time to do what I have just done looking at these ""reviews"" and having the heart to start asking questions in the right places.

United Kingdom,11,1,08-May-21,5,2,2021,DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY,"On the 24th of March I made a complaint to this shambles of a company regarding miss selling of a sim only contract by their member Three. Prior to this I was in deep conversations with the customer care team at three who to be fair was fantastic. The customer care team at three absolutely agreed with me and said they would get this addressed. They spoke to the credit file team, but they said they would do nothing about it. I then received a letter from three who said I should contact these scammers should I wish to make a complaint. So I spoke to a lady who took my complaint, and to be fair was fantastic. I contacted the Ombudsman Services in good faith on the premise that they would conduct a fair and extensive investigation. I have them all the information including dates and times of when telephone calls was made between myself and Three. I also stated, if you retrieve the call that’s was made you will clearly hear the customer care team at Three say that I was definitely miss-sold. My complaint was about an existing sim only rolling contract I had with Three but I also required a new handset as my old phone was getting old and was in need of replacement. I purchased the headset I already had through apple years ago. Three was unable to provide me with the new phone but the overseas Sales Scammers said we can upgrade your sim but unable to provide you with a new phone. I decided to leave three, giving the required notice period and paid my final bill. I decide to use Vodafone as they was willing to provide me with what I required. I then this year decided to obtain a copy of my credit report only to establish that Three have completely disregarded why request to terminate and have actually upgraded the sim.  I contacted Three and explained that I had indeed cancelled the contract. Their customer care team agreed and attempted to have the default removed. At the time of complaint to the so called Ombudsman Services they assured me that they would look at all evidence. I provided my evidence in a statement to the lovely call handler at the Ombudsman Services. I have just received the conclusion of the Ombudsman Services so called half naked investigation and it’s absolutely clear that the Ombudsman Services works and is fully financed my the Defendant Three. Essentially the Ombudsman has without doubt Cherry Picked evidence to support their Client Three. They have completely disregarded the Call  Evidence  that was a significant part of the investigation and also dismissed my case. The Ombudsman Services claim to be Independent, but this is not the case as they are financed my the Companies they investigate. A respectable independent Ombudsman organisation would indeed request funding from the government. Not your friends the large companies that you are so called tasked to be impartial when investigating. I have also learnt that Vodafone have cut ties with this outfit and are now using an alternative, one client less for the Ombudsman Services. I have already spoken to a solicitor and we have formed the opinion to run it through court. That is also my advice to anyone who is experiencing issues with these large companies ( DO NOT USE THE OMBUDSMAN SERVICES ) complete waste of space and it’s only an opinion based services. Finally. I will be instructing my solicitor to commence legal action against Three ( which I should have done at the beginning rather than use this waste of space organisation). I will also be asking my solicitor to review all the evidence I have against the Ombudsman Services, believe me I have plenty and report this organisation to ALL regulators together with all the evidence to underpin my complaint. I will also be speaking to my local MP. All in all, waste of space of a service, they are NOT independent and very lazy investigators. Hopefully OFCOM will cut ties with this corrupt organisation. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. ITS A MICKEY MOUSE OUTFIT...... Update......Thank you for your reply. Firstly your not independent. Regarding the ( Evidence Based) yeah, you only cherry pick what favours your client. You have completely disregarded all the evidence I provided. STAY CLEAR OF THIS COMPANY",Yes,11-May-21,"Hi Andrew, We are sorry that we weren't able to provide you with the resolution you were hoping for.

United Kingdom,9,1,08-May-21,5,2,2021,Extremely Poor service,"I contacted the Energy Ombudsman due to having extremely bad experience with the Utility Company Utility Warehouse who forced me to have a smart meter against my wishes and without my consent or permission and now say I owe them £185 for the energy used. The issue was clearly simple to see that my Electricity meter was dead and needing replacing that was all needed doing. I contacted the Energy Ombudsman to see if they could help and they took on the case. My family were put at risk of increased infection due to the installation of a smart meter put in without my consent or permission. I sent the Ombudsman all the information they needed as evidence. Even a post from where it states on the Utility Warehouse website that I screen shotted and sent the Energy Ombudsman. Consumer Law and that of Trading Standards says companies or businesses are breaking the law if you put something on your website which is not true. It's misleading. Section 75 Consumer Law covers a variety of specific things. You have to know what you are looking for. I know what my issue is. The Gas Act was breached and also Electricity Act but yet no action taken. Ofgem has warned Utility Warehouse of enforcing Smart Meters and most recently fined for overcharging its customers. I wouldn't mind but I wasn't in any debt until Utility Warehouse but the smart meters in. Something that again clear evidence from the evidence shown. I was having a conversation at one point which was overheard by Nadia a Staff Member of the Energy Ombudsman as my daughter had gone to the shop to say the Paypoint cards didn't work. Nadia was quite concerned that the electricity supply if it went off would put my daughter in danger due to illness my daughter has.  Huge inconvenience from Utility Warehouse and the Energy Ombudsman can't see what is staring right at them. Nadia has been the only one to know that something had gone wrong but not sure what section of the Energy Ombudsman she worked in. She is the only credit to the company.I simply wish I had not even bothered. The time wasted with the Energy Ombudsman a solicitor would have done it quicker and got an outcome either way. Even a small claims court would have got to some satisfactory outcome either way. Lack of due diligence to my case and closed twice without a good reason. I'm not sure why you are even helping customers Energy Ombudsman because as far as I can tell you are not impartial at all and are not for consumers. Consumer Law does do its job when it is practiced accordingly. It's not hard to see common sense when needed. It's a disgrace that Consumers are feeling hard done by when lacking of diligence. The message that has been sent to the Utility Warehouse Energy Supplier is they are entitled to keep ripping people off customers and the Ombudsman will not offer a partial service due to no payment coming from the consumer which holds no value. This is clearly evident to see. And I'm not sure what the heck they have been doing all this time and no update by email to keep me informed either if they can't get to me by phone and they have my email so no excuse. I'm not sure what the Senior Staff member Thomas Little was doing as it's been no help to me. I was told an Investigation would happen and I have not seen a result.  So, I am left with the same problem as I started out with from the beginning. Utility Warehouse will be delighted to have the cases closed but not so happy when a solicitor letter lands on their doorstep and realise that they paid money to Energy Ombudsman was a waste of time which Utility Warehouse will now have to pay out even more for so they can get out of the trouble they are going to be in. Thankfully, for me, I understand Consumer Law quite well due to having excellent teachers. This issue with Utility Warehouse will be resolved but not by Energy Ombudsman they don't have time unless they are paid or can even be bothered. Not for profit?? You could have fooled me.

United Kingdom,7,1,19-Mar-21,3,1,2021,Don't use this service - it is worse than useless,"The service was pretty hopeless.  I was expecting a dispassionate examination of the case but the adjudicator simply accepted all the excuses made by the supplier (Plusnet) and ignored my submissions.  Just in case I just sound like a disappointed complainant, without going into all the details basically Plusnet made a promise that my broadband service would be set up on the day I moved into the house.  On that basis I entered the contract and paid in advance.  There was no service on day 1 and In the end after 12 days and after several hours on the phone the service was eventually up and running.  The adjudicator ignored my submission that I would not have entered the contract in the first place if I had been told the truth.  And when I had to use extra data on my mobile during time when I was actually paying for a non-existent service, which cost me additional fees, she refused to order Plusnet to refund the cost!  So don't use these people - they do not seem to be truly independent and you are wasting your time.

United Kingdom,1,1,01-Mar-21,3,1,2021,NOT FIT FOR PURPOSE did not even mention BACKBILLING CODE (Google it) Resolution  by others - 10 years of £24k faulty smart meter billing 12k reduction OSL £100 laughable,"The full case which will be published elsewhere later, would actually have merited forfeited billing compensation under the “BACKBILLING CODE” in excess of £18,000 had the Energy consumer representation and UK regulators actually been what was established as a part of condition of the original Utilities privatisation some 30 years ago - it isn't - and Ombudsman Services Ltd are part of a deliberate consumer averse, consumer wear down strategy put in place recently by the government and industry to provide the specious appearance of robust representation/investigation/adjudication1. ""Ombudsman"" is a Swedish word and means “representative or agent of the people”. Sweden had the first ombudsman in 1809 and other countries used the word when they appointed Ombudsmen of their own.2. This was a very commonly understood definition of what any “Ombudsman” would be in the UK and various ""Ombudsman"" have operated under independent auspices in different areas of government, commerce and industry for many years. 3. Unfortunately in the case of the UK privatized utilities, the very structure of government regulatory processes somewhat bizarrely provides protection of the large utility companies which is actually against the very citizen/consumer's interests that they were set up to safeguard. 4. In the case of the energy utility companies ""Ombudsman Services Limited"" (OSL) is certainly NOT a representative or agent of the people, so should not be allowed to use the title ""Ombudsman"", at all.5. The reality is that OSL are a private limited company directly funded by the membership of the energy companies. They have a proven track record for taking most advantage of the absence of the even handed evidence discovery processes in para a. below, to avoid proper transparent review of citizen /consumer evidence, invariably leaving serious claims unexamined with nominal slap wrist ex gratia payments allotted to the citizen / consumer which are very seldom in any way proportionate to the actual financial loss as a serious injustice caused, nor anywhere approaching even their own disproportionately small compensation limit of £5,000.(at the time)a. A simple comparative example of this, is where the consumer is obliged to endure the lack of powers (or will) of OSL which despite professing independence and consumer dispute resolution, do not operate with anything close to the even handed processes of evidence discovery, objective evidence interrogation / investigation and simple adjudicating powers of the UK law courts or other reputable dispute resolution bodies. – There must be important reasonable question as to why not?b. The so called “investigation” undertaken by an “investigator” is nothing of the sort – It is a paperwork desktop study without all of the open discovery or examination of evidence or contact of witnesses one would reasonably expect to be essential to an investigation especially with often statutory, technical best practice, or serious safety matters at stake.c . Although OSL claim that if a utility company fail to respond to them within a standard timeframe they will continue to make a judgement without them – in this case First Utility /Shell Energy  were allowed to grossly exceed this timeframe without sanction .6. In this particular case had OSL truly performed according even to their own hopelessly weak professed roles and responsibilities (as specified on their website) from the outset, it is extremely unlikely that First Utility/Shell Energy would have been afforded the ongoing opportunity to abuse the interests of their consumer over such a prolonged period.7. However it goes deeper than this, because as stated ""OSL"" isn't an ""Ombudsman"" at all, because it certainly is not a “representative or agent of the people” and should have no direct financial, performance, or other organisational link with the very corporate bureaucracies that the ""people"" (individual energy citizen/consumers) are seeking representation or agency against.8. Before the gathering use particularly in the last 6 or 7 years of the internet by consumers, , the poor performance of both First Utility and OSL could only have only been reviewed in the isolated experience of each individual citizen/ consumer and any aggregation of complaint would therefore have inevitably been denied and crushed by the powerfully resourced corporate bureaucracy of each of those organisations. 9. In fact the poor performance of OSL is so bad that it is now widely and very negatively reviewed on the internet consumer sites, in the national press and on TV.  However it appears they are even managing to squew those statistics by extremely questionable 5 star reviews.",Yes,04-Mar-21,"Hello Ernest,  Thank you for taking the time to leave us your review.As you have said, we are funded by the providers that sign up to our scheme and they pay us a fee for each case that we review, but they have to pay us the fee regardless of the outcome.

However I was not allowed to see their response. Unbelievable. Also taking into consideration that the people who I’m complaining about  pay your wages to investigate my complaint.

What a complete and utter joke.  All the providers, Plusnet, Sky, Talk Talk etc all use Bt's phone lines to provide a broadband service and yet if they provide a poor service as in my case with Plusnet, its not there problem because the line is not theirs.  My contract is with Plusnet and its Plusnet that should be held to account.  Not so according to the Ombudsman.

United Kingdom,3,1,05-Feb-21,2,1,2021,Serious shortfalls in service,"Clearly the the Energy Ombudsman, funded and working on behalf of the energy companies, are most certainly not arbitrary or independent.The average consumer naively believes that referring a complaint to the Ombudsman will achieve a satisfactory and appropriate outcome. After going through extraordinary lengths just to prove I had even made a complaint to the energy company concerned, obstacles were then placed in my way, I believe to obstruct and deter me from progressing with my complaint. Midway through the process whilst waiting  for correspondence from the Ombudsman, they somehow failed to pass on important information between their own departments and unwittingly closed the case. Only through great determination and perseverance did I finally achieve a reasonable outcome, and that after a further appeal. The disturbing thing is energy costs are a major outgoing for most consumers. If my experiences are reflective of how energy companies conduct their businesses then there are serious shortfalls in services provided. Clearly a radical change is needed in order that the consumer has genuine recourse and appropriate representation when an agreeable outcome with an energy provider cannot be reached.",Yes,08-Feb-21,"Hi Gerard, I'm really sorry to hear that you weren't happy with your experience when using our service and had that problems when initially trying to raise your complaint with us.Our Investigations Officers take our consumer complaints very seriously and consider many factors when conducting their investigation in order to reach a fair decision.

The person who replied to my review needs bringing to task for not addressing the points I made that were also made in my feedback to the Ombudsman who claim that feedback is important to them. To me, the only feedback they listen to is compliments and there can not be many of them when you read Trust Pilot!I do not do reviews often, but if you look back on what I do review, you will see that I always try to give a fair reflection of my experience and this is my first ever negative review!Original review.If there was an option I would not even give it one star!This is the first time I have used the Ombudsman service and certainly the last. The whole process is a disgrace for the ordinary person, especially if you are not very computer literate. The site is difficult to work through and all that should be necessary is for a member of the public to report a problem, they check the evidence and that of the supplier and then make a decision. This could be a simple letter or email that is acknowledged and considered, so why it is made so complicated really is a concern, especially for the elderly or less able.No doubt they will attempt to justify the process where I believe a body such as theirs are not very good listeners and always know best finding excuses for what really is inefficiency. In my opinion this is an inappropriate process that is probably very expensive.I will happily explain further to them but do not expect a response as this is the second time I have completed one of these surveys for the same case, so to even ask me a second time demonstrates the point I am making.An organisation who are in their own world and never listen, Inappropriate and inefficient.Incidentally, I won my case so no reason to be bitter!",Yes,10-Nov-20,"Hello, we're sorry you are unhappy with your experience.

United Kingdom,13,1,15-Nov-19,11,4,2019,A puppet of the energy companies - No incentive to improve their service..,"We had suffered appalling service from our energy provider including multiple bailiff visits relating to a previous householder, un-returned phone calls, inflated bills because of the tariffs we had been locked into and general unbelief of what we were telling them. In the time we were locked in and not allowed to leave, we overpaid by £80 for our energy against their better tariff. The ombudsman even agreed with a number of our points. The energy supplier wouldn't even set up an account for us, never mind letting us move over to another provider. They thought they would get away scot free without even any compensation but we had other ideas. We reported to them to the Ombudsman and their immediate offer was £150 and an apology which we thought was poor. What has to be taken into consideration is that letters do not pop up without effort - and there were a lot of them, sometimes running to 7 pages or more. Consider the hours of work in that lot.I took a look at the reviews and saw that many of the complainants had poor grammar and spelling so guessed that their complaints were equally badly organised. We were not going to make THAT mistake - make it easy to read and follow for them and they will see how poor the company was. Another four hours of file organisation and renaming for clarity.I was wrong. Their final decision was for £100 and an apology, and that was supposedly taking into account the losses. In a nutshell, that is eighty quid and twenty for the weekends spent letter writing.With such poor levels of compensation there is no incentive for the energy companies to improve their customer service. Until somebody grabs this organisation by the throat and shakes some consideration into them to fully assess not only the financial losses incurred but also the effort and stress inflicted by these monoliths on consumers I fear the situation will not change.If the compensation awarded in our case is typical - and I suspect it is - the energy companies have nothing to fear whatsoever.The Ombudsmen have an excess of work to do? Perhaps this situation is related to the facts that they are funded by the very hand they are supposedly biting and they are the victims of their own failure to bring the energy companies to book in the first place.",Yes,18-Nov-19,"Hi Chris,Sorry to hear that you are unhappy with our decision in your case.We always strive to make decisions that are fair, looking at both sides of the story and the evidence provided.

United Kingdom,16,1,14-Dec-18,12,4,2018,Ombudsman Service ignore consumers' evidence,"The Ombudsman Service appears to be working entirely on behalf of the big service providers. My complaint was against O2, who had failed to unlock my wife's phone when we were moving both my phone and my wife's to Vodafone. O2 then failed to keep up up to date - the Ombudsman called this a ""failure of service"" - and effectively did nothing that they had promised to do. O2 offered me £150 and I felt this was inadequate for the hours I had spent on the phone to O2. The Ombudsman took weeks to look at the evidence but took O2's word for it when what they said was clearly simply not credible or feasible. They decided that O2 had been too generous and cut the offer to £30! I pointed out serious errors to the Ombudsman, she just ignored all of this and stuck with her £30.The Ombudsman seemed to believe that O2 texted me to say that they had a problem unlocking my wife's phone. No, they didn't. They texted me to say they had a problem unlocking MY phone - which was OK as I was sure that it wasn't locked in the first place! I pointed this out to the Ombudsman but she just ignored this.In effect, there is no appeal against rank stupidity and partiality by the Ombudsman and I am left with the suggestion that I can pursue O2 in the County Court! I can't even be bothered to take O2's £30. I did come away feeling that maybe O2 are paying off the Ombudsman - but surely that can't be true, in this day and age? Surely they are supposed to offer an impartial service and look intelligently at the FACTS - maybe be a little bit sceptical about what O2 tell them they recorded on their systems and ask for hard evidence to support it.If you try to Google ""Complaints against Ombudsman"", their are hits on Google, but when you follow the links they take you to an explanation of what the Ombudsman does to arbitrate (allegedly) on complaints against service providers.

United Kingdom,4,1,02-Nov-18,11,4,2018,Very disappointed. Did not even read my case properly! NOW WITH UPDATES!,"I turned to the Communications ombudsman on the 18th of  July. I sent them a 40+ long supporting documentation regarding Vodafone tricking me into a 2 years contract for 75£ a month promising a new upgrade phone every year. Only to turn me down after the first year that it was not what we agreed.At round one the ombudsman investigator has concluded her investigation and starting that with "" you have not provided any supporting documents"". Seriously? I provided  tons of pages and they did not even read that. Then she was on about me not raising the issue sooner with Vodafone however I have a transcript from Vodafone early this year where I made inquires  about my upgrade. I also have a chat transcript from Vodafone what says: Me: "" my issue is this is not what I was told when I signed up. So I was expecting a free upgrade option in May. Vodafone advisers response ""I completely trust your words and you are not wrong at all. that was only the confusion been created from service advisers.""So Vodafone admits it`s mistake in writing!That fact among else were completely ignored by the first investigator who referred to Vodafone as Three so her response seems to be a copy paste response.I appealed only for them to completely ignore their 4 weeks response time  and only after I followed up telling me that the investigator assigned to my case is abroad. ( I assume on Holiday) and they need an other week to get back to me.After the appeal was sat on 5+ weeks they completely ignored the above transcript ( whoever has eyes can see what the transcript says)  and all of my appeal in fact stating there was no material difference. So they did not read my arguments properly ignored relevant points and when I appealed they were late and basically just dumped me not even responding to my appeal in detail. This is the worst experience I ever had with any provider. Worst than Vodafone. I understand OS are not protecting customers but that was not a fair approach and since they did not read and responded to my arguments properly they were biased towards Vodafone. Not even one argument of mine were upheld! At least in worst case scenario they could have said there was some ambiguity on Vodafone`s part.UPDATE:OS get in touch and telling me again that I have not provided supporting information while I have an email from OS confirming that my supporting info was returned. Very poor service even in higher levels. I have a financial loss now 500£+ including my time . They offered 20£ compensation and admitted they could have handled the case better. Thank you for nothing.  I asked them to escalate this further and they are now ignoring me for 10 days. Below just some of the quotes from vodafone management.In the conversation with Vodafone directors office the manager says: "" My colleague admitted it was an advisor error. So for that advisor error we are offering 20£ as a good will gesture""And later on she says "" we are in an understanding what you are saying we are in an understanding that an advisor mis sold you something that is completely out of.our business rules and that is why we are saying that please go to the ombudsman and they will investigate it for you""The previous chat transcript we are referring to was: ""29 Mar. 2018, 12:32am my issue is this is not what I was told when I signed up. So I was expecting a free upgrade option in May Operator:, 29 Mar. 2018, 12:33am I completely trust your words and you are not wrong at all. that was only the confusion been created from service advisors.""SERIOUSLY HOW COME SO FAR NOBODY LISTENS TO ME?????",Yes,05-Nov-18,Hello.

United Kingdom,44,1,12-Oct-18,10,4,2018,Very appalled by the service from SSE & Ombudsman,"Very appalled by the service from the Energy Ombudsman's initial findings. I suspect that it is a waste of time going through this body. Despite being very ill and checking to ensure my account was all up to date once I was better, and being assured that it was and there were no outstanding balances on the account.Only to learn some time later they were wrong to tell me that, and it seems that is ok, really? So they SSE are now chasing for a £1300+ retrospective bill on one utility yet the other was not out in that manner. Ombudsman is not interpreting some of what I explained correctly either and like another poster unless you know how to write it in a very legalised way its hard to get understood properly.How is that fair? I'd have switched supplier sooner had I known that.It's clearly a waste of time to take things to an ombudsman especially seeing the other reviews. I sense there is just a lack of impartiality. But either way I am appalled by SSE's approach.Had it even been suggested that a bill could be so high, a) I'd have switched sooner and b) looked to reduce any usage or checked what is causing it. Denial of the correct bill as they claim, denies you the opportunity to do that too.I am disappointed at the process with the ombudsman, seems stacked n the companies favour.Update: The energy ombudsman is a sham process. I have been ill in a car accident and dealing with some health issues, and yet they issue a final decision with clear errors and no one is bothered to ensure that my full information is obtained or considered. What a waste of time. The whole process is biassed to the energy supplier. With hindsight I wish I had just not done this process, just go to the court system and argue your point.

Not sure what qualifications they have to undermine those trained in the field. This shows just how bias they are to the company that pays their wages.

Again despite the fact that the Information Commissions Office said the company had breached my data protection sharing my personal emails with neighbours.  The Ombudsman clearly thinks it is okay to do this and I have no right to privacy or equality.

Like I have said to British Gas THIS IS NOT MY DEBT.I feel British gas is either holding me to ransom, because they know I am going to move in any way or they are using backhanded tactics to get ME to pay SOME ELSE'S debt.I need this looking into now. Not in 8 weeks time.I don't want this hanging over my head for all that time.If you're interested, Energy Ombudsman please read my LONG review to see what has been going on.Re: Your reply.So you allow energy suppliers to hold someone to ransom. Either I pay £150 + on a pay as you go card (+ extra), BEFORE I get a gas supply to the property. Not been able to have a gas check, or shown how to use the new heating system.

United Kingdom,11,2,04-Aug-23,8,3,2023,Does not protect consumers from abusive giant businesses practices.,"Ombudsman it is good bridge to put you in contact with people that will be aware of your helpless journey into very poor customer assistance. The downside however, has a very weak legislation to rely on that does not protect enough, consumers from abusive giant businesses practices. In my case , very similar to Michael, a person that commented here, and I will use his words; it was ""pathetic"" the outcome, an offer of £75 for line credit to a non-existent mobile network (3Mobile). For four months I have had no service at all, May(since 11th) June, July and August. The June bill due on the 12th I refused to pay while dealing with customer assistance, I ended up paying on the 19th(7 days later). On the 30th they sent a message saying the service would be back as I paid the bill ( I never received this message, I read in their register of interactions through the Ombudsman case). But still, I keep disconnected with no calls inbound or outbound. It is shocking how this Country comply with bad business practices! The message is "" You should be happy to have £75 as a credit, as it is very ""generous"" (the case worker used this word) an amount equivalent to 8 months of your monthly airtime payment.""  Thank you, Ombudsman, I must be on standby for service that will come back who knows when, because there is a mast problem in my area, but I should not be angry because I will not be paying while I wait for the service to be back! Really? I just would like to have a mobile phone that works as it means to be! Caseworker was Tom Pearson but I do not blame him in full, as I noticed my case was decided by jurisprudence reading the comments here, I blame very absent legislation that really cares for the powerless, instead, keeps being blind to unfairness. If any of them had their mobile phones disconnected while paying the phone bill, would they be happy to have a credit line for the bills but no clue when they would use their phone again?

The Ombudsman closed the case and advised me to contact EDF direct (which I have been doing for more than a year) or contact Citizen Advice whose website directed me back to the Energy Ombudsman. As the Energy Ombudsman is funded by the Energy Suppliers, it’s no surprise that they have no teeth and are a complete waste of time. No wonder EDF weren’t too concerned about me opening a case.Additionally, they even copy and pasted part of someone else’s case in their closing letter to me, so I’d better add incompetent to the list of adjectives.",Yes,17-Jan-23,"Hi John, We are sorry that you have not had a positive experience when using our service.

So every month I have to get in the cupboard on my hands and knees to get a reading.I would consider also an E.V but without access to a E.V tarrif it would not be financially viable. I contacted the Ombudsman to see if this situation could be resolved but apparently all that's on offer is waiting for the SMETS 1 meter to be updated which will be completed by June 2025. You would of thought with the enfisis on going green there would be more interest in helping customers achieve this aim but apparently it will come as no real surprise that energy company profits come first. Look at what is on offer for what we export into the grid, yes a whole 3p per KWH!!! hardly going to encourage solar purchase!Thank you for your comments BUT I see today in the press that there has been an increase in the number of people having their meters changed to pre payment meters so a meter change can be carried out when a supplier could lose income! You are on the side of the business and stuff the customer!",Yes,25-Oct-22,"Hi Mike, we are sorry that you are not satisfied with the resolution to your complaint. There are some connectivity issues between smart meters and the DCC (data communication company). As this isn't something that a supplier is responsible for it does rely on the DCC to resolve any communication issues, which will need to be done by 2025. We understand that your circumstances may prevent you from reading the meter, we would advise that the supplier put you on a priority service register which would mean that you would be a priority for having your meters read by a meter reader.

As is its right, the supplier appealed on one decision point. This is where the system becomes unfair. A separate investigating officer adjudicates on the Appeal. In my case, the supplier’s Appeal was upheld but absolutely no explanation was offered as to how this Decision had been reached. I have no idea whether the Appeal review was based on all the evidence presented or on nothing more than the toss of coin made in the investigating officer’s kitchen. If consumers are to have confidence in the process, then EOS officers need to explain in detail how they have arrived at a particular Decision. Of more concern, once the Appeal has been issued it becomes the EOS Final Decision with no right of further Appeal. In my view, there should be an enshrined right for either party to ask for a senior investigating officer review of the process that led to the revised Decision. It shouldn’t be necessary to have to raise a complaint against EOS. In sum, the Appeal process is broken and it needs to be reviewed: EOS needs to go the extra mile to ensure that the process is seen to be fair on both parties. Having said that, it would seem that EOS is pretty dismissive of anyone suggesting that their processes are flawed so I am not expecting much to change. It is perhaps time for another Ofgem review and public consultation.",Yes,11-Apr-22,"Hello.

First they're so inept that the response named the wrong Energy provider.

They make the directors of the Post Officelook competent.I've not been given an explanation of the ruling that is relevant to my situation that stands up to the test of scrutiny. To justify an asinine decision a ""Leader"" had to resort to making up a  situation which involved myself inviting staff from an Energy provider that I'm not a customer of, but are complaining about,in to my property while simultaneously removing the implied right of access to said energy provider.

I paid the energy bill in full leaving zero balance. British Gas then paid the compensation into my energy account which was not what they were supposed to do but deducted it from the original bill amount which makes it look like I partially paid the bill and the compensation made up the remaining balance.  The bill does not show me in credit which it should, so BG have robbed me basically leaving me nearly two hundred pounds out of pocket. Ombudsman closed the case down on day of agreement and left me 2 weeks on still in dispute with energy supplier and problems with them as they have NOT paid me what I am owed.Contacted the case officer at ombudsman and no help from them at all.DISGRACEFUL - I’m out of pocket by almost two hundred pounds.I’m going to make a strong complaint against the ombudsman now to get this sorted.

We made no progress from June 2022 to June 2023 with OVO to resolve this using the route of their Customer services and their Advance  Resolution team who assured me that they had investigated this. I called the Energy Ombudsman around the 11 July 2023 and spoke with Olivia. She listened to the facts, was effective in all her communication with us and reached a resolution by the 16 October 2023.We received a goodwill gesture of £250 from Ovo to take off the bill and all of the overcharge was removed from the account.

I have left E.On Next for another supplier, E.On Next continue to send me further bills and demands that I do not owe, they continue to threaten me with debt collection for money I do not owe. The ombudsman has closed the case. I now have to now appeal to the courts service to do what the ombudsman should be doing. I wouldn’t recommend anyone use the energy ombudsman.

Eon then wanted to impose an additional fine of £120 for my refusal to pay for electricity that was never used.  The Ombudsman agreed that Eon were well out of order and made a logical ruling.

United Kingdom,5,1,03-Aug-23,8,3,2023,NO DISABILITY AWARENESS.,"I wrote a detailed letter with accompanying British Gas statements to the energy ombudsman 2 wks ago. All the info was there yet I got a phone message and letter from the ombudsman asking what the complaint was about? I have 2 degrees and like to think I conveyed this in the above letter. I then spoke to a man yesterday at the Ombudsman to answer their questions. The chap said you don't need to repeat it all, we already have the info I'll just allocate a case worker. I then immediately spoke to a man called Chris at 1.15 pm ish....am putting the time so someone responsible their end will listen to the appalling call. In sum, this Chris asked me numerous questions which were already answered in my cover letter above and was more about what he couldn't do as opposed to what he could. I re-iterated that I have a voice disorder and cannot keep saying the same thing over and over again. WILL SOMEONE YOUR END PLEASE LISTEN TO THIS CALL.By the time I got off the phone from the above I was left feeling very upset, tearful and cried at how difficult things are when they needn't be. On reflection I then phoned the ombudsman up again today 3rd August 2023 to speak to a manager and another obnoxious, perverse man answered. I explained that I cannot say all info to him and then his manager due to my disability, and can he just put me through to a manager please. Again, 101 questions i.e. not just security questions but what my complaint is about with British Gas. Again like the man yesterday, he wound and wound me up, goading me like a man poking a dog with a stick.

So I turned to the Energy Ombudsman for help.  Eventually they made OVO see sense, and made them pay £100 in compensation.OVO sent me an email, confirming this.But when the next bill arrived - it was back to square one.  The demand was still the overcharged one as before.So I went back to the Energy Ombudsman, explaining what had happened.I said all I wanted was a bill from OVO for the correct amount.  Could they make OVO do so?My reply:  “You’ve got to do that yourself.”So what exactly is the Energy Ombudsman for?They’re just a waste of time.I’ve decided to go to my MP about them, and see if he can make OVO send me a bill that is correct, not inflated to an amount they picked up out of the air.Energy Ombudsman?

They have accepted twisted answers from the network and done nothing when this is pointed out.

I will not approach Ombudsman in the future and I won’t recommend anybody to their services. They won’t accept any of your points but only consider T&C’s small prints of companies.

The Ombudsman decided that because I was able to take readings and send them to Eon each month they were working correctly but smart meters should send readings automatically and my meters were set to send readings every half hour so clearly they are NOT working correctly              I was offered £50 in compensation & an apology letter which at first I didn’t want to accept but reluctantly I decided to accept it because the ombudsman said they could not tell Eon to replace the meters.So I am stuck with smart meters that are not smart,Yes,20-Mar-23,"Hi David, we are sorry that you are not satisfied with the outcome of your dispute.

I went to the Ombudsman as British Gas put me on the wrong tariff, wanted me to have my bill in someone else's name in the house, and couldn't give me online access to my account. The Ombudsman provided an outcome that stated 1) They need the account in my name2) They needed to put me on the correct tariff3) They needed to give me online access to my account4) They needed to provide £150.00 and an apology.4 Months after BG couldn't implement what the Ombudsman asked, they made the Ombudsman change the outcome to remove the fact that I should access my account online. How does the ombudsman think in this day and age it is OK for BG to tell them to change their outcome because they can't give their customers access online despite it being the outcome initially (and months prior) that the Ombudsman requested?I was thoroughly disappointed with Julie Smith's approach and her communication.

Registered a complaint against 3 - mobile for failing to refund the PAYG credit as per the statement in June 2022 prior to changes in tariff.  Each and every mobile phone number is a separate contract.  Everyone knows that as it is basic law. Because I had one previous successful complaint against 3 for a different number and thus different contract, this useless Ombdudsman Services claims the complaint is a duplicate.  Even 3 mobile recognised that it is a separate contract and had even provided a 8 week deadlock letter.  The incompetent Ombudsman Service wilfully ignored the deadlock letter which even states that a referral could be made. It is not a duplicate if it relates to a different contract.  3 mobile has a duty to use a ADR service but has opted for these incompentent low lifes.  The Ombudsman Service applies this same disgustingly incompetent approach to other suppliers.A formal complaint will be made to 3 and Ofcom as 3 have failed to provide an adequate ADR system.",Yes,19-Oct-22,"Hello, we are sorry that you are unhappy with our services.

United Kingdom,1,1,03-Oct-22,10,4,2022,It all seemed promising,"It all seemed promising, after nearly a year of hassle with Ovo energy & Boost who intermittently disconnected my energy, closed my account and failed to respond to complaints I raised a case with the Ombudsman. This all started when I asked boost to change my gas & electricity from Payg meter to monthly billing.A fairly straightforward request you would think!! Over a year I had failed engineer appts, meters that did not work, energy being disconnected until finally I had 2 new meters but no billing system to pay. Ovo fitted monthly pay meters but my account is ‘closed’.The ombudsman concluded that I should receive an apology, compensation & confirmation that my billing account be set up in order that I can set up a direct debit. All I ever wanted was an active account to manage my bills, compensation was a bonus for the hassle. Ombudsman have now advised that my supplier has implemented all actions and closed the case as ‘resolved’(they have not). They have issued an apology and applied a credit to the inactive account BUT the whole purpose of raising the case ‘ set up an active account for billing’ has not been done. Pointed this out to ombudsman who suggested raising my ‘ new’ issues with supplier.It’s not a new issue it is a none implemented issue which formed the basis of my accepting the decision in the first place.I even sent screenshots yesterday showing the account as ‘closed’ and ‘ we no longer supply your energy’ - Ombudsman closed case based on Ovo saying all actions completed.If Ovo said the moon was made of cheese would they accept this at face value?.I have to say it is bad enough when you have to battle with your energy supplier but when the ombudsman does not grasp an existing issue that is not dealt with ( the key issue !!) it is disheartening. It’s hard to establish who is more incompetent my supplier or the ombudsman.I feel badly let down by the ombudsman who came up with a recommendation but then seems to have dismissed parts of their own recommendation even when the evidence is there.Dont waste months of your time with the ombudsman, a pretty pointless operation.",Yes,07-Oct-22,"Hi Margaret, We are sorry to hear that.

Eventually Eon were made to correct all the mistakes and overcharges on my bill but only after I recalculated all the charges and complained back to the Ombudsman.

Obviously I knew this was wrong as she eats at my house most days, works 2 days per week and then spends time at her grans. For months Eon next took this £331 despite me being in contact via email, phone, messenger begging them to investigate her account. The stress was huge! I contacted the ombudsman and gave everything I had for them to investigate which took approx 6 weeks. There outcome sided in Eon next's favour on everything apart from lack of communication for which they advised Eon next to credit my daughter's account with £30! Ultimate outcome... Forget the ombudsman just call my mum. After finding out the ombudsman's decision and seeing how upset we were my mum went to citizens advice and started right from the beginning with a number to ring for Eon next and ..........

United Kingdom,8,3,08-Sep-22,9,3,2022,Fallen at the last hurdle,"I have a large, old farmhouse that has three electrical phases installed - but I was only using two, via two single-phase meters. I installed a three-phase suply in my workshop in order to use a lathe and a milling machine and in August 2019 I asked Scottish Power to replace my two meters with a single three-phase meter. Three years later I was still trying to ger Scottish Power to do this and in desperation I referred the issue to the Ombudsman. Within a week I had a date from the 'Scottish Power Ombudsman Team' (yes, they have a WHOLE TEAM devoted to this). The date - 1st September 22 came and went, no-one showed up. They re-scheduled for 6th September and an Electrician from 'Providor' (an out-source company) appeared but refured to install the meter as there was a fault on my unused third phase. He raised an emergency fault call with 'SP Energy Networks' - the infrastructure people. They were excellent, I had three teams here over three days and on 8th September the fault was fixed. All I needed then was to get the meter installer back - simple I thought . . HA !The Scottish Power Ombudsman Team have declared the issue 'Resolved' and the Power Ombudsman Service have accepted this, despite me rejecting the conclusion saying 'its not over until a meter is installed and working'. Neither party is now answering e-mails or phone calls, in effect they have 'ticked their boxes' and gone.So close, yet so far, what a waste of time.Who knows, maybe Scottish Power will re-schedule the meter installer and all will be well, but I fear another three-year battle to get a one-hour job done. I may have to raise another case with the Ombudsman as Scottish Power are experts at ignoring all requests from customers.",Yes,12-Sep-22,"Hi Bob, We are sorry to hear about the ongoing issues you are facing.

From the moment I was in touch with them I was pleased with the service - responsive and helpful. My investigating officer was not only clear and concise regarding his findings but also knowledgeable and helpful when I had follow up questions. Their customer service couldn’t be more opposite to that of Shell. Their system for uploading evidence is simple to use. Overall despite contacting them because of a rubbish customer service experience I was left feeling supported. It is a shame that they are unable to award compensation and that they don’t publish their findings - maybe then companies might be more inclined to better serve their customers rather than to leave it to the ombudsman to find them at fault.,Yes,12-Sep-22,"Hi Marie, Thank you for taking the time to share your experience of using our service.

With one meter roof hight in a cupboard and the other outside at ground level, it is impossible fo us to read the meters but now we are left with continual estimations as the ombudsman believed Eon-Next.

Strange that they never tried to resolve it. My complaint was totally ignored, customer services constantly ignored my questions and failed to provide any info I asked for.

This ended up with the amount reversed as Bulb tried to back-bill me over 2 years, even though they knew the rules did not allow this over more than 12 months.

Instead, I received an email on one Sunday afternoon, which a decision which had taken none of my evidence of the suppliers overt profiteering and economy with the truth. I appealed and subsequently received the welcome call this time. After a conversation with the investigator, I had hoped that my salient points would be addressed. This was essentially asking for the ombudsman to suggest to the supplier, a fair and equitable solution; I wasn't looking to dodge any liabilities here; but this was handled with the same indifference as the first review. I thought that the Ombudsman Service existed to bring two sides together to reach agreement. In view of their actions here, it appears that they exist to take a salary and tick boxes. This is not, as their name is meant to imply, mediation. In effect; a total waste of time and public money.

They refused to refund us and by this time the energy hike have caught up on us which have caused us to struggle to make the ends meet.So after a good few months of ""dispute"", I have to escalate this to energy ombudsman because I thought It was the right thing to do, and it was a big mistake.The investigation went on and on for months.The person in charge of the case have been completely unreachable after the resolution have favoured the energy company. Even though all the bills and evidences have been submitted accordingly, but no they said everything wasn't correct and OVO was right not to have refunded me the money they've owed.So I have tried to reach Tony.

However, the point where the judgement was delivered and it became clear that Ombudsman services Energy didn’t find British Gas had done anything wrong/misleading towards the consumer (despite the evidence provided), had no power to influence them or implement what British Gas’ information said originally based on their ambiguous tariff information (which British Gas had later changed knowing it was contradictory), the whole process became a let-down, a bit of a waste of my time (and hopes) and in the end futile.British Gas clearly stated a Price guarantee with an end date on a (supposedly ‘special’) variable tariff (that also had an end date), then removed the guarantee (a sign of guilt/error on their part?) and stated the price guarantee was ‘guaranteeing the ‘special’ tariff’.  The price has now risen in line with the price cap - which goes against the original price guarantee and means I’m paying the same as everyone else so clearly the tariff can no longer be ‘special’, not to mention this is all before the stated end date of ‘special’ tariff.",Yes,25-Apr-22,"Hi Mr S, We are glad you found the process easy and the members of our team helpful.

United Kingdom,7,1,07-Apr-22,4,2,2022,Reposting this again because the…,"Reposting this again because the ombudsman actually had it taken down! Not only is the service terrible, they’re actually taking down reviews! Shocking! This is my very disappointing true account. Nothing breaches the rules! Where to start with this? Firstly, this service is neither professional nor impartial. I went to them about a mobile account, expecting a full and valid investigation. What I received in the way of “service” was evidence I had supplied being completely ignored, the mobile network’s account taken at face value - with no evidence needed - and the lies the mobile account had continued to preach to me, passed back to me as an investigative “decision”. Even worse - and I find this absolutely shocking - the investigator actually fabricated an extra “missed” payment that didn’t exist, despite my bank statements showing everything had been paid. He continued to argue with me, fabricating this extra unpaid invoice from somewhere yet refusing to acknowledge the evidence I’d sent. For him to continue arguing showed stunning ignorance in the fact he was completely wrong(!) yet had no factual basis to levy it on and failed to look at the statements. I’m staggered by the unprofessionalism of this “service”. And could not and would not recommend. The investigation - not that it can be called that - was lazy and careless. For an investigator to fabricate an additional payment (that even the company didn’t say I owed as is clear on the invoices) leaves me lost for words in actually making the situation worse. This has actually caused more stress and anxiety by being gaslighted and spoken down to by the regulator. He also got the name of the company wrong and made it clear my words or value was worthless. What an appalling way to treat a customer. He also failed to see that the company had broken a contractual obligation and sided with them about it. Information I gave was entirely ignored and recorded calls were not requested, despite me asking for this. I have since been told they can’t do this - not sure why, when the financial ombudsman can when investigating - but was told this after the investigation, rather than before so I could have somehow tried to request this myself. If you’re expecting a professional, impartial investigation, look elsewhere.UPDATE: 22/03/2021 I am absolutely appalled at the investigator at this point. After writing this yesterday he has written a FURTHER message arguing against me still. And STILL lying about this payment - for which he has no evidence. If he can’t figure out a bill and evidence, he should not be in this job. This behaviour from someone who is supposed to be impartial and who should be treated customers with respect is appalling. Ombudsman has completely failed.UPDATE 07/04/2022 The investigator - who would rather argue with me than look over the evidence and see where they went wrong - sent me their “evidence” of this extra payment- which proved they were completely wrong! Did I get an apology for the stress caused? No. Have I had communication from the ombudsman complaints department since raising a complaint about that investigator two weeks ago? No. I have appealed the decision, and Still heard nothing from them. No communication from the investigator now looking at the appeal. The communication -  for being a communications ombudsman - is, ironically abysmal.",Yes,11-Apr-22,"Hello, We are sorry that you are unhappy with the service you have received.

The ombudsman closed an open complaint (without consulting me) and left the one open which had incorrect factual information that I was unable to correct or amend on their systems and that which I could not attach any evidence for as their system wouldn’t allow it. They refuse to respond to my communications, I have lodged a complaint about them closing my complaint without first asking me which one to close, further it’ll take them 10 days to investigate themselves by which time British Gas should have responded to the incorrect complaint which is not fully formed.         Today, I have lodged a claim against British Gas and Sainsbury’s Energy which the county court to get a swift resolution and it only cost £35…. Money worth paying.

The investigator appears to have investigated nothing in detail and admits to having no expertise on 50% of the complaint so accepted the paymasters version of events.Better to use a newspaper or other avenues for a complaint because this (dis) organisation has difficulty in separating fact from fiction.

Providers pay us a fee for each case we review. They pay this fee regardless of the outcome or decision we make.

The fee doesn't affect our decision making and allows us to provide a free service to consumers who need us. We understand that it may be disheartening when you don't receive the outcome that you were hoping for however, we have to ensure that we look at the facts presented to us by both parties before issuing a decision.

Even though I have lots of evidence I didn’t think taking on a huge company like TM was ever going to lead to anything but I was determined to get another perspective. The initial “work” involved in putting a case together was quite daunting but they helped me every step of the way. I was very upset with the response TM gave to my report, making me out to be a liar and even a bit stupid but I pressed on. Once everything was submitted I just had to wait for the claim  to be investigated and a decision made. I received an email today with the decision and it had been upheld. I was over the moon that I’d been listened to and given the respect I deserved. The final report was fair and impartial. It was never about the money it was simply about being treated like a human being instead of a selection of numbers.

United Kingdom,5,2,03-Feb-22,2,1,2022,Best intentions but flawed process,"Having now completed this process, I have tried to be as fair as I can in this review. I was actually very impressed with the first part of this process. I had a difficult ongoing problem with a truly awful energy company, and the Ombudsman officers were very good. The first part of the process meant that both sides could submit evidence, comment on each other’s evidence and then the officers make a decision based on that. All very open and fair. The decision came down on my side based on that evidence. The problem is that the energy company then appealed the decision, could do so by submitting just a few lines of text and the decision was then changed. As a complainant I had no opportunity at all to comment on this subsequent evidence, and no opportunity at all to appeal the second decision. This is where the process is stacked against the complainant. The appeal should follow the same format as the initial investigation, there is no reason why it cannot (the appeal officer could easily read the appeal evidence AND the complainant response/evidence), but the process does not allow this. The three stars that I have given are for the officers, who did their best, but it is sad that they are having to do so under a process that is so bad. Overall, it is worth using the Ombudsman service. As frustrating as it can be, they are a million times better than dealing with certain energy companies, but I wouldn’t get your hopes up!EDIT: Oh dear. I spoke too soon. I had an email saying that the energy company had complied with the actions and asking me to check. I checked. They had complied with one, another (a very feeble and grudging apology) was on the way but for the third they had only refunded around 20% of what they had been told to refund. I informed the Ombudsman of this, expecting them to ask the energy company for more details of why they had done this. Instead, the next day I had another email saying that the case was ‘resolved’. So the company had no carried out the actions as far as I can see, the Ombudsman has been made aware of this, yet they still closed the case. So after all this stress and time, I am not really a lot better off than I was to start with, and now I have to complain about the Ombudsman as well. A real shame.",Yes,07-Feb-22,"Hi Richard, Thank you for your feedback on your experience. We are continuously looking for ways to improve our processes, so your review is really important to us.

Their customer service was appalling and distressing in phone calls and emails as I worked through their complaints process. By mid November we were at “deadlock” ( their words)  so even though they told me I had no case I took it to the Ombudsman service. The Ombudsman service have been brilliant with every email and phone call and by early January had ruled in my favour.

The excuses from SP have been wide and varied over that time, and sometimes farcical (“your night usage pattern must have dropped to zero due to COVID)….I don’t know of anyone in the country who uses zero units overnight for months on end!In each instance I feel neither SP or the Ombudsman have fully understood the problem (partly due to the complex nature of smart meters) which has led to some questionable remedies (eg: suggesting fitting a 5 terminal meter when there are no storage heaters).Despite providing ample evidence to show my night rate % which, while not recorded in the meter was visible in the app, over 2 year old data was used to estimate usage patterns. In my case this was prior to doubling my usage due to car charging at night so was clearly not comparible, however this was dismissed. I feel that while the Ombudsman is sometimes the only route to closure, they may not fully understand the problem or take on board customer evidence, which seems a little one-sided.",Yes,18-Jan-22,"Hi Graham, Thank you for leaving us your feedback.

That's why I couldn't provide a meter reading ! Eventually I got a direct contact with Evolve thanks to the Ombudsman and a strict timeline. That said, further incompetence and communication issues meant each time line was either missed or just met in time. Rather than strive to excel Evolve appeared to be taking the mickey as far as I'm concerned. For instance, they provided my final statement bang on the very last day so they didn't have to give me the 30 quid compensation........ In the end I got my rebate but meanwhile moved house so will not have to deal with them again. Finally  fyi, Evolve did not have a speak direct to customers function.

United Kingdom,18,1,03-Dec-21,12,4,2021,Not fit for purpose.,"CORE ISSUE: Bulb remotely wound on my smart meter without telling me, to the tune of around £150. Yes, suppliers can do that and I bet that's something you didn't know! When I challenged them, Bulb said, to quote ""We only do it in exceptional circumstances""!!! That's perfectly OK then... NOT!It had taken ages for  ME, not the ombudsman, to figure out what had happened.After a process which took literally months, I disagreed with the first judgement and appealed. The result of that was a more acceptable judgement, albeit another several weeks later. Except the now-defunct bulb appeared incapable of implementing it in full, and when I complained to the Ombudsman about that, they said their job was done and refused to enforce. So my question is this:WHY ON EARTH HAVE AN ARBITRATION SERVICE IF THEY ARE NOT WILLING TO ENFORCE THEIR RULINGS?I get the strong impression the service was more interested in not upsetting Bulb than sorting out my problems.Not fit for purpose and, like most quangos, a scandalous waste of taxpayers' money, because it is unaccountable itself.EDIT 6/12/21 in response to OS reply.""we do also have a remedy implementation team who are responsible for escalating any outstanding remedies if our consumers feel they have not been fulfilled"".

United Kingdom,1,1,03-Dec-21,12,4,2021,Absolutely useless,"Edited on 9th Feb at bottom- do not delete the facts! Absolutely useless, like others have said do not waste your time and energy. Even when the investigator realises you have a case they appear reluctant to even attempt to apply the rules, Back Billing Code, that the energy supplier, SSE in my case, have signed up to via their license.  Even the my small amount of credit left on my account that SSE did not attempt to refund for over a year later, the investigator was reluctant to direct them to issue a refund cheque.  Just a completely opaque and one sided process, simply not balance or impartial at all, even when the facts presented in the evidence, supplied by the energy supplier no less, are as clear as day.  The process is designed to wear you down so you simply give up, especially when it is apparent the investigator makes little attempt to review the supplied evidence or understand the issue.9th of Feb, update: The finalised review that I published above has been heavily edited. Did the EO not like hearing that their staff failed to apply the back billing code? They ignored a 3rd party meter reading, provided by both myself and SSE evidence pack, and instead allowed SSE to continue with estimated billing. Then finally SSE produced a catch up bill bulking all electrical usage into a period where the had just increased prices, almost £400 of electricity was charged at the increased rate, over the last few weeks. When I drew this to Daniel's attention he agreed to look into this, but all seemed to much too much bother for EO to implement their own rules. If the EO whishes to dispute these facts, you are welcome to contact me. I would advise Trust Pilot against editing my factual review!Also, the EO have replied to me stating they ""investigate disputes fairly and independently""- does this include ignoring data supplied, in this case 3rd party meter readings, provided by SEE themselves, that they and then the EO chose to ignore?",Yes,07-Dec-21,"Hi Mrs Smith, We are sorry to hear about the circumstances that led to you raising a complaint with us.

The investigator in my opinion either could not understand or was not willing to see my point of view on this and repeatedly suggested that I had done well, where as I see it, I had simply been a savvy consumer and was now being punished for this most heinous of crimes.I was left with the distinct impression that the links between energy companies and ombudsman are too close",Yes,07-Dec-21,"Hi Rich, We are sorry that you were unhappy with the outcome of your complaint.

United Kingdom,20,2,03-Dec-21,12,4,2021,Thorough but Toothless,"I was overcharged by a utilities supplier who were at best incompetent but more likely carrying out a corrupt practice. While I knew they were in the wrong, I was hassled and threatened with court action on a regular basis, while I tried to sort things out with them. They ended up being un-cooperative and I felt compelled to take my case to the OS.Luckily, I keep good records and having taken the supplier to the OS, providing accurate figures and invoice copies, they found in my favour, that I had been overcharged. The utility provider was told to re-issue a final invoice for the correct amount, (less £30 for my inconvenience) and letter of apology. I settled the (correct) invoice without delay but the apology never arrived.I have two issues with the OS;Firstly, their compensation award of £30 discount to my bill was in no way reflective of the time, effort and stress I was put through as a result of the providers poor practices and incompetence.Secondly, and more importantly, the apology, (which never arrived) when coupled with the £30 award is absolutely no deterrent to these companies. I was lucky in that I keep good records and understand the power supply charges and billing systems. However, for everyone that does, I am sure there will be many many customers who take the supplier's figures at face value and overpay accordingly. The OS did a good job of reviewing my case and came to correct decision as to who was in the wrong but their ""punishment"" for such practice is no deterrent and leaves the OS looking like a toothless organisation. Coming down like a ton of bricks on such shoddy providers, is the only way to get them to get their house in order.

United Kingdom,9,1,14-Oct-21,10,4,2021,A deeply flawed 'service' in need of change!,"Given the high number of poor reviews of this service, it is high time in my view its purpose and future direction was the subject of a thorough overhaul. While it might still be viable for the most straightforward complaints where the 'evidence' is hiding in plain sight (e.g. billing disputes) (which is  also why it delivers the 5 star reviews on this website?), my experience says it is incapable at present of coping with those of a more complicated 'technical' type. By definition, it is severely handicapped if the supplier concerned refuses to co-operate (as in my case concerning SMETS2 meters). But to make matters worse, the Ombudsman's approach is then further constrained by a series of self-imposed barriers on the types of supporting 'evidence' it is prepared to consider during the investigation itself (e.g. that available from credible 'third parties'  is excluded) . As a result, the investigation centred in my case on the exchanges with the supplier's call handlers who were either unwilling or unable to move from the ""computer says No"" type response. Unsurprisingly, with the supplier refusing to co-operate, the Ombudsman's conclusions were based on conjecture wrapped up in several paragraph's worth of text to give it the necessary 'gravitas'. Unfair? Unkind? What else could I expect in the circumstances?  The most constructive suggestion I can make therefore is that it should either change its investigative approach or simply restrict its 'service' to those types of complaint where it has a better than even chance of satisfying the complainant.  At a time of rapidly rising energy costs for consumers and businesses the latter would at least save us all some money! Finally, the Ombudsman may be tempted to respond to this review by pointing out that my complaint was 'upheld' (!). It was, but only on the basis of poor 'customer service' and not the range of much more substantial issues that gave rise to me making the complaint in the first place.P.S. I have now read the Ombudsman's comments below and the requirements for taking matters further on the ""Unhappy"" part of the website. The latter states that you can complain about ""a failure to follow our processes"" but cannot dispute either the resulting ""decision"" or the ""evidence"" used to justify it!! As I have tried to point out, my experience says it is the processes that are wrong, notably the exclusion of third party evidence (and indeed anything the Ombudsman might have 'learnt' on earlier compliants on the same issue - the failure of a SMETS 2 meter to send automated readings in my case ) because these impact directly on the quality of the ""evidence"" that is investigated. To be clear, this means in my experience the Ombudsman is forced to make a guess (but wrapped up in more exotic terminology:  ""the balance of probablities"").  This is plainly unsatisfactory and I would argue ""unfair"" on the complainant who can only present the ""evidence"" he/she has as a result of exchanges with the energy supplier. And as explained above, in my case these were severely constrained by the latter's ""computer says no"" approach and then the refusal to co-operate.  I am therefore reluctantly forced to conclude that this 'service' is seemingly incapable of reform and agree with the majority of other reviewers that it is a waste of time (excepting those cases where as noted above, the 'evidence' is plain to see and incapable of misinterpretation). It also follows from the above that I shall not be commenting further on this site.",Yes,18-Oct-21,"Hello, We are sorry that you are unhappy with the investigation of your complaint.

I declined as wanted it investigated (yet another company taking our money to the bank but giving a terrible service) As I declined my case is now closed.

I also liked the Ombudsman's website and the process of capturing my complaint.   Although my complaint was upheld, I felt that the remedy proposed came no where close to equating to the atrocious service I had received from EON or reflecting the time I had spent  trying to resolve this matter.    It did nothing to send a message to EON that they need to significantly improve the way they run their business.  I'd even go so far as to say, it actually sent a message to EON to say, actually, it's not really a problem if you continue to treat your customers this way and it's ok that your processes are not fit for purpose.  As a result, my conclusion is that I have wasted my time in pursuing this matter and I actually, regrettably, also conclude that the Ombudsman  service is not effective in driving improvements to the service customers receive from energy providers.   It makes me very sad to say that I would not recommend their services to others.",Yes,20-Sep-21,"Hi Angela, We are sorry to hear that you didn't feel the outcome of your complaint reflected the situation that you faced with your provider.

The incompetence of this organisation is outstanding first the ruling was in my favour, but they failed to consider a few points and the response I got involved lies. •	“Based on the review I must state that although I appreciate the shortfall highlighted was not mentioned in the initial investigation” (OS Investigative Officer)o	is reading the evidence required or had you already agreed with the energy supplier the outcome? the fact that this was included as a comment in the evidence I’m guessing it was ignored.  •	The next one the person reviewing the appeal claims to be a “Senior Investigation Officer”, however according to the performer details the “OS Senior Investigative Officer”, remains unassigned and on the job title next to your name is “OS Investigative Officer”,o	Are you lying or are you unable to fill out a basic form?•	“Your next comment is that the report does not address the denial that Octopus Energy passed on your details to the debt collection agency. You advise you have the email chain to evidence that Octopus Energy initially lied to you about referring your account to the third party debt collector. As Octopus Energy has not provided evidence to dispute this, and based on the balance of probability I will accept your version of events as true and consider you to have received a shortfall in service.” (OS Investigative Officer)o	If lying is a short fall in service why are you claim to have a different job.o	Does this mean that according to Ofgem is lying allowed (could explain a lot here) •	“Your first comment is that the previous data protection policy/privacy policy stated that it would only pass on details when a valid debt occurred. You state this this is different from the current version and you consider that not making this available, is against the license requirements of the company to be transparent in its activities and keep records of any information sent to customers. I have noted your comments and appreciate your concerns, and whilst errors have been made by the supplier, we do not consider there to be a breach. Should you remain concerned about your information, you can refer directly to the Information Commissioners Office (ICO).” (OS Investigative Officer)o	The complaint was about how octopus handled by data and they broke their data protection policy/privacy policy, the fact you just noted that they provide a different version to what was originally used sounds like you’re not very impartial or incompetent, based on the evidence above I can only assume that you are an incompetent organisation that has already agreed the outcome with the energy provider so don’t need to see the evidence.

They didn't even bother to tell me what was said by the energy company and just 'closed' my case before it was even properly open and I had a chance to provide them with any further details or 'evidence'. They have a system of so called 'policies' that are heavily biased in favour of the energy company and basically just set the 'customer' up to fail. When you question them for being useless and failing to actually do something they just say sound bites like ""that's not how it works""..... we need evidence of it from you"". But they refuse to ask for any evidence from the energy company being complained about! That is by definition totally biased. The customer must provide 'evidence' but the energy company doesn't! The whole crux of my complaint was about the energy company refusing to provide 'evidence' and bills etc to support their demand for payment and failing to provide other relevant information within the subject access request. I was even told that the Ombudsman are not allowed to request any information from the energy companies about the customer to avoid 'bias'. How can any resolution be reached when the energy company are  refusing to give the evidence to me and the ombudsman can't make them give me the evidence. The whole process is just an utter waste of time. Its like banging your head against a brick wall. Its like the blind leading the blind. If you think your energy company is a nightmare just wait until you experience this lot. Grossly inexperienced and unqualified staff reading a pre written script or following a flow chart they don't understand. (Cue pointless generic cut and pasted response from the ombudsman.

Our role is to provide a dispute resolution service between the parties involved and, whilst we work with the providers and provide insights to help improve customer service and reduce complaints, we aren't a watchdog or regulator so we aren't here to punish anyone or dictate how companies operate, that is the role of the regulatory bodies.We understand that you weren't happy with your experience however, we appreciate you leaving us feedback and allowing us the opportunity to address your concerns.

United Kingdom,1,1,30-Apr-21,4,2,2021,The service is a complete farce,"The service is a complete farce.  My experience was terrible.  I provided full evidence of my case and was advised that they were not able to consider it on the evidence and I would need to take it to court if I wanted that.  They marked the file as upheld - ie they acknowledged that O2 had made errors in the handling of my complaint so they were asked to make a £30 payment for my inconvenience.  However, my credit scoring was still completely ruined as they did not uphold my complaint on the balance of probability not on the evidence provided.   In short I cancelled my O2 contract, left the country and 18 month later found that they had continued to take payments.  The bank refunded some of the payments and O2 hounded me for these.  I raised a complaint and they put it on my credit file.    I could evidence everything but because they had issued a PAC code and continued to make contact to a phone and number I was not using I was liable.  The account was never used for the period and O2 could not provide evidence that it was.  They knew my phone was not working, they knew I was leaving the country for work for a period (I was 20 years old) but still they wanted my money and were going to make sure they got it.  They have completely ruined my credit score as they were the only people I had a contract with.  The Ombudsman is not interested in facts, they would not look at the O2 site which clearly states how to cancel which I did.

I emailed, sent photos, spent hours on hold. I have recorded videos of Ovo and Boostnoth lying. I have emails from Ovo saying I owe them £257, which I paid in one go. They then gave it to Boost. Even though the bill was from Ovo. Then Ovo billed me £328. The EO just says, set up a payment plan with Ovo.....IVE PAID OVO. I was in dispute with Boost as they refused to fix my meters. Promised countless times to call me back, and never did. All this sent to the EO.....and still she sided with Boost saying she was satisfied made attempts to call me.

The number of complaints against a provider will also feed into statistics about the quality of their customer service.10/03/21 Ombudsman Services' (OS) reply ignores the statement I made in my original review, that is, I spent over eight weeks engaging constructively with Plusnet's customer support team trying to resolve the problem while their IT team ignored us.As someone who has worked in IT for many years, I pointed out in my complaint that Plusnet could resolve the issue with their website in a couple of days, something that was disputed by the OS decision maker, even though the same person also said that commenting on Plusnet's operational procedures was outside their remit.So, OS felt qualified to dispute the professional view of someone who worked in IT, after stating that this is an area upon which they cannot comment.

United Kingdom,12,1,30-Jan-21,1,1,2021,Ombudsman Service is NOT an Ombudsman but is a SCAM ! TRUE,"Contrary to what you might expect the Ombudsman Service was not set up by government and therefore has no powers.  It is in fact a private company but without any shares or any owners.  It receives around £25m per year from all the companies that people complain about and as far as I can see is desgined to give those companies very cheap solutions to their problems.  It does not distribute a profit but seems to pay large expenses to its many directors which I suspect often come from energy companies!  My experience was that they found in my favour but then offered a pathetic £100 compensation and did not force the energy company to correct its errors that have cost me thousands.  After doing some research I discovered that the proper organisation setup to resolve such complains is called OFFGEM but of course no one told me this, it is not on any of the energy bills and also the Ombudsman Service was very misleading when I asked what legal powers does it have, I beleive that they were misleading because I doubt that they want the truth to get out that they are themselve a SCAM !  So if you have complained to them ensure that you REJECT any decision.Response to reply: ""main bodies"" that you refer to are likely set up and run by trade bodies i.e. energy companies and therefore are not impartial.  I am sorry that you did not bother to research my actual complaint even though I provided the case number.  Yes I am aware of the right to appeal and I did appeal.  The appeal again found in my favour and again failled to provide a realistic level of financial compensation.  The model that you operate is simply not impartial.  Your model is like me registering a company called The Roll of Solicitors and then selling membership certificates to anyone that wants to call themselves a solicitor i.e. it would be a parallel register to the roll of solicitors set up by Parliament i.e. The Law Society / SRA.  Hopefully now the truth about your misleading and biased organisation is in the public domain, less people will waste their time with you and ultimately it will not be financially worth the energy companies continuing to pay you £25m per year.",Yes,03-Feb-21,"Hello Paul,  We are governed by a number of main bodies who oversee our work to ensure we remain impartial and everything we do complies with the latest standards.

The fact that right after my (bad idea of stopping the DD at the bank as a method to secure dialogue) Three immediately started treating me as a delinquent payer and never acknowledged a service issue or tried to address it. Instead I was bullied with daily calls followed by the use of debt collectors.Strangely the Ombudsman was not interested in knowing whether the charges coercively collected by Three were right. I demanded that Three explains the charges as after the Ombudsman decided Three miraculously writes. After their denial of the existence of my calls I tried to have written communication.

Otherwise the small claims court might be better? Spent A YEAR fighting my gas company only to be prevented with a new fantasy bill that I was forced to pay. Eventually got the payment back but no compensation for my wasted time. Apparently that’s “no worthy of compensation” - great eh?!? The whole system is voluntary, they have no teeth and seem to just believe what the companies say without questioning their responses. Also they are definitely not experts on the calculations of the bills etc.Re: reply from Ombudsman...I did appeal, you just did the same again - listened only to the gas company. I did provide you with VAST amounts of evidence, TWICE. Most of which you DID NOT READ. I know you didn't read it because of your replies, which clearly indicated you had not read all the information I provided. Also, you have a conversation with the gas company, but you only allow the customer to fill in information BEFORE you talk to the gas company - you don't re-contact the customer during the process, only at the end to give them your decision. This is NOT an arbitration process, you come to a decision without allow the customer to challenge the data given to you by the gas company during the decision process. Ok, you do give ONE chance to appeal but that's not the same as having a conversation with the customer. The entire system is pointless, misleading and seriously biased toward the gas companies who, apparently, you are supposed to be holding to account... Again, another joke.Incidentally, I also forgot to say, that the only reason we recovered our bill payment (which I still believe we should never have been made to pay) was because of a separate 'bad service' issue and NOT because the Ombudsman decided we shouldn't have to pay the bill.

That's a big no.Given my experience I'm really not surprised that their Trustpilot rating is absolutely appalling.

Ombudsman Services were quick to investigate and ruled in my favour. This was classed as an Early Resolution i.e. the energy company concerned did not dispute the claim, and a quick resolution was agreed. Great service!All good? Well it’s at this point that it all started to fall apart....The Early Resolution was agreed in October 2018. I waited a month but the energy company did not comply with the decision. I then followed up with the Energy Ombudsman who promised it would be sorted. Another month passed, not resolved. I followed up again, and again and again... every few weeks....Anyway it is now May 2019 and I am still waiting for the agreed resolution to be completed. It has so far been 7 months since Ombudsman Services ruled in my favour, and I am still waiting for the energy company concerned to comply with the ruling.

United Kingdom,25,1,07-Mar-19,3,1,2019,Things I wish I knew about the OMB,"Things I wish I knew before starting an energy complaint with the Energy Ombudsman:1) NOT tax-payer funded so ZERO government authority or protection.  They are instead funded by the very companies they are supposed to be a watchdog for (conflict of interest what?)2) Their decisions and awards on companies are advisory ONLY.  They have ZERO enforcement powers3) Responsiveness and attention to detail on complaints is poor.  I don't know of the qualifications required to work there, but from my experience, I had to explain things several times, then got cut/paste responses seemingly without checking any actual facts4) Clunky website that requires upload of all documents through a cumbersome portalSo I, like hundreds of others I presumre, have suffered at the hands of Solarplicity's awful customer service.  No problem I thought, that's what the Energy Ombudsman is here for right?  So I complained to th OMB and initially received an award against Solarplicity.  Then the fun started with the OMB.Because Solarplicity said they'd implemented it and the OMB NEVER even bothered to check that in fact it had.  Solarplicity was basically lying to its regulator and the regulator would go ""well, we don't have the power to actually check the facts"".  BUT WORSE, the OMB actually doesn't have any authority to follow-up non-compliance and force the energy companies to perform.  It's all voluntary!So people, if you think you're getting a legally binding, enforeceable solution, please please think again.  You'll spend as much time - more time in fact - chasing the OMB and correcting their understanding of the facts, as you did chasing your energy supplier.I've even asked how I can get my case within the OMB escalated after weeks of non-response to my queries and guess what?  No response.If you keep your expectations low and bear in mind the above severe limittations, you might have a better experience than I did with the Energy Ombudsman",Yes,11-Mar-19,"Hi Craig.

It transpired that their emails to EE to return the number were not getting through due to problems with O2's system.  One honest O2 operator told me this shortly before the matter was resolved, but the official O2 investigation covered it up and lied to me.  Furthermore, the operator told me that it had affected many accounts as well as mine.When I referred the matter to then, the Communications Ombudsman refused to ask O2 to provide the phone calls, deeming it not necessary.  Despite evidence of systematic lying by O2, they told me that it was not within their remit to report the matter to Ofcom, or to fine O2.

United Kingdom,12,2,11-Jul-22,7,3,2022,Ombudsman Services,"Things that worked:1. Administration system for the processing of cases efficient, with the staff helpful.2. Time deadlines were adhered to by the staff investigating the case.3. The investigation was detailed, and genuinely impartial towards both sides, and didn't seek to favour the utility company.4. Once the utility company had been found against, the financial compensation was procured from it without a problem, and the administrative system to this end was efficiently arranged.Things that didn't work:5. It's easy for the public to make the mistake of thinking the Ombudsman's Service is a quasi-judicial authority, based on the same principles of a court, i.e., writ, evidence and reason & logic. From my experience it's not. The Ombudsman Services is an ARBITRATION body, aimed not at justice/right-wrong, but the de-escalation of arguments between consumers and utilities & dispute resolution, i.e. settling an argument and getting rid of it as expediently as possible by trying to placate to a degree both sides. It also, as a part of the British Government's ""light touch regulation"" culture of privatized utilities, has imposed upon it v. limited powers to award financial penalties against the utilities when they have been found at fault. From my experience even what limited financial penalties it can award are routinely kept v. low by the investigating staff, in line with internal guidance they've been given by the management. I won't say that this makes the Ombudsman Services useless, or that it leads the utilities not to take it seriously (because they don't like losing a penny), but it certainly limits its ability to correct poor standards in the utilities with the issuance of penalties that are chickenfeed comparative to the financial size of the utilities involved, which you as a consumer are required to jump thru extended very involved evidential hoops to obtain, having to prove everything that you are saying with highly detailed written explanations and copies of material.6. Altho the staff are helpful & approachable when you are working within their guidelines/admin. process, the minute you question any aspect of it, the customer-friendly demeanour disappears and they compel you back into line with their process in a pretty brutal & unprofessional fashion, regardless of what the problem being raised is. The ubiquitous statement that the ""Ombudsman Services is keen to hear how it can improve its processes"", and assurance of how flexible it is in this regard, just is not true.7. The Ombudsman Services investigative conclusions upon my case were partially successful, but badly undermined in part by the issue of #5 above. Things were turned a blind-eye to, and (already soft) financial penalty punches were pulled. 8. The appeal process to try to correct this (from my perspective) achieved nothing more than an illogical rubber stamping of the first decision.9. The Ombudsman Services 'Independent Assessor' was pretty useless & dreadful, and a new one is needed, the current occupant gives the impression of having been in post too long & having become a bit too close to the organization they're meant to be independently reviewing.",Yes,11-Jul-22,"Hi Ajax, Thank you for taking the time to leave us your review.

United Kingdom,1,2,03-Mar-22,3,1,2022,"Nearly impartial, but not quite.","It is a mistake for Ombudsman Services to describe a case as ""Case resolution implemented"" simply on the word of a company which has already demonstrably failed to live up to its commitments. It's like asking a burglar ""Have you given back everything yet?"" It has the appearance of taking sides. By enquiring solely of one party whether the case has been resolved they lose their impartiality.While I was fairly satisfied with the decision, hence 2 stars, it is a time-consuming process and I have little confidence that the resolutions will be implemented. Furthermore I have to post my feedback before the invitation to do so expires.

Went to OS and completely different experience – Investigative Officer treated me with professionalism, courtesy, respect, took ownership of problems fairly quickly. Got most of my issues resolved favourably in apx month. Main reason I didn't score higher was because I didn't get an important grievance resolved (majority resolved however).

United Kingdom,24,1,20-Apr-23,4,2,2023,Electric Smart meter not worked since…,"Electric Smart meter not worked since it was installed last year. The first  member of staff agreed with my case and instructed EDF to replace the meter. EDF appealed and then “ a member of staff with the title “coach “ accepted the EDF appeal. This coach was rude and did not want to understand the facts . The facts which her colleague agreed with me on in the first instance.Who on earth trains these people their whole interaction with the public needs addressing. How can one employee who has been trained in the same way as this said “coach” find in my favour and another one not ???? It’s not as if EDF’s appeal was even any good no detail etc . So now I’m left with a faulty SMART meter and some smug coach sat at her desk couldn’t careless.. AWFUL service and the “coach” needs to be re-trained . There's no consumer protection from this organisation just a biased view which falls nicely into the energy suppliers lap.*** Thank you for your response but this will not change the outcome of this “coaches “ decision which is unjust and unfair . Even Ofgem state that if a meter is faulty there should be all attempts to fix it , if it can’t be fixed they should REPLACE it….. you coach thinks differently… This is where the training and understanding of the issue from the consumers view point is lost . What use is a faulty non working not fit for purpose SMART meter which, has not worked from day one to anyone ????* To close said Coach has not even closed down the case even though she sent me an email telling me she will no longer review my case …. “Coach”  and I use this word very candidly  ., you need to close this case down .. so I at least get my letter of apology and compensation. You may have a huge ?? thumbs up by your manager for allegedly closing this case…  which I and you know is wrong .. But , at least finish your poorly attempt of doing your job professionally..Reading all the reviews on here is so sad.  The ombudsman staff need to be revamped, re trained and not so measured  by their management on closing cases so quickly. ( check out glass door  for the reviews by employees) horrific ….

United Kingdom,17,1,22-Aug-22,8,3,2022,No better than the lousy company you're complaining about!,"These people are evidently recruited from the same gene pool as those employed by the electricity companies: they can't read or write or spell, they never grasp what your complaint is fundamentally about, they don't look at the evidence properly (sometimes they even deny having received it—despite having earlier sent letters acknowledging receipt!), they willingly accept the company's version of events even when it self-evidently doesn't add up, and they take an excessively long time to achieve ultimately NOTHING (other than wasting your time). In the past two years, I've taken two complaints to them, one on my own behalf and one on behalf of an elderly parent. In both cases, the original investigation missed the fundamental point of the complaint and ultimately made no difference to the problem. You aren't allowed to complain about the same thing twice—even if the same thing is still happening, because they failed to fix it before!So, both complaints had to be taken back to Ombudsman Services, dolled-up to look like new complaints.  The second investigation of my father's problem proved to be an even bigger waste of time than the first: after two years, and two successive investigations, he still has disputed arrears of £3,000 hanging over him, for reasons we still do not know—jolly well done, Ombudsman Services!  Meanwhile, THREE successive investigations of my own complaint have achieved absolutely nothing.  Nor has complaining to Ombudsman Services about their total ineffectiveness: they appear to regard it as normal.The best you can hope for is (eventually...) a paltry £50 or maybe £150 ""goodwill"" payment, which will barely cover your stationery and postage costs—to say nothing of your time or your stress—and which clearly makes no difference to the electricity company itself: they'll just carry on exactly as before.If the purpose of an ombudsman is to get justice for the little guys, and hold the big guys to account—well, this so-called service is NOT fit for that purpose.UPDATE 24th March 2023: still no further forward, several more illiterate letters from Ombudsman Services and several more totally inaccurate electricity bills, but no actual progress whatsoever...",Yes,22-Aug-22,"Hi Reuben, we're really sorry to hear you've had a negative experience of using our service.

Whilst we can't always guarantee a result that the consumer is hoping for, we do try to provide as much support throughout the process as possible so we are saddened to hear that you were made to feel that way by our team. The technology behind the smart metering system is complex. As such, several problems can occur which prevent the system from working as intended. A common problem relates to the signal strength or signal quality between your smart meters and the networks they connect to. Unfortunately, signal strength and quality issues are outside of the energy supplier’s control and as such, they are unable to resolve them unless the signal strength and quality improve in your home or in the area around your home.

United Kingdom,24,1,02-Feb-22,2,1,2022,Ironically,"Ironically, after attempting to raise a complaint regarding Eon and their level of incompetence and unworkable systems which resulted in our being left with massive bills and no recourse, we decided to take the matter up with the ombudsman only to find the same level of incompetence and unworkable system with them.Initially I raised the complaint back in August 2021, uploaded what I considered to be relevant evidence and was then told because the account was in my wife's name, they would require her agreement to continue.   I then uploaded a letter, signed by my wife authorising me to act on her behalf (she is disabled and cannot manage many of the day to day affairs and she is the account holder after we signed up for a tariff deal through our local council and she is the main benefit recipient).This sat dormant for a while so I emailed them to explain I had uploaded a letter of consent.   We then received an email explaining we would be required to have this done on their paperwork rather than a letter.   No instructions or guidance on how to do this!.  Emailed back requesting how this was to be done and received a response with the enclosed paperwork.My wife signed it and I uploaded it on the 5th January 2022 along with attaching it to the email.   Since then we have received further automated emails telling us our case is still in draft pending ""additional checks required"", we go onto the account and it tells us ""Account holder authorisation required""?????!!!!I understand it may just simply be a delay due to staffing problems, but really?.   As far as I was aware, this was the only outstanding matter to be resolved to allow our case to move forward and start being looked at, but it's been a month now since uploading the authorisation documents they requested and the status on the case hasn't moved, yet we have received further automated emails telling us our case can't be looked at because it still requires ""Account holder authorisation required""??.Really doesn't fill me with a great deal of confidence that an organisation that is meant have our backs can't get their own act together and leaves us in limbo whilst the energy provider in question stamps all over us with more bills and a refusal to acknowledge the failings in their systems and hold our accounts to ransom whilst asking for meter readings we have already told them we cannot provide, if this is an example of what's to come with organisations such as this then it's game over for us consumers, it's only going to get worse in the next few months with the ending of the price caps and everything is going to go into meltdown!.",Yes,02-Feb-22,"Hi Mark, We are really sorry to hear about your experience so far.

The interesting is when you will appeal against your decision, the same caseworker will review the decision. That's really funny and unethical too. They didn't put the same weight on your evidence and the evidence that submit by the supplier. For example, I called the supplier to notify them about my occupancy. The caseworker didn't consider it because there was no evidence. But the National Gas claimed that they called my Landlord and they didn't provide any evidence in support of it. But the caseworker accepted the statement. There are so many things that could be put as evidence of biased decision.

United Kingdom,4,1,30-Dec-19,12,4,2019,This service needs urgent change,"This service is a desperately poor.  The simple fact is that, even though the Ombudsman found in my favour that BT had overcharged me for 5 years, they blamed me for not spotting BT's mistake and awarded me only 5% of the money that BT had wrongly taken.The Ombudman's remit is to be ""Fair and Reasonable"" yet their decision in my case simply encourages BT to: a) overcharge people -  as they have no incentive not to, b) never ever correct their own errors,c) never to pay back money even when they've admitted they've wrongly taken it - which was the situation in my case.During the formal process, BT were allowed by the Ombudsman to ignore the formal deadlines for evidence and then to subsequently submit blatantly incorrect evidence which was accepted by the Ombudsman without me even being made aware of it.  Only when I demanded a formal investigation did the Ombudsman finally agree, after 2 months, that their own process had been badly mishandled from the point at which they accepted the late and incorrect 'evidence'.  However, rather than reverting to the Officer's original decision, made before the late submitted and incorrect evidence, that BT should repay 100% of my money, they appointed another officer to 'start again'. The new officer concluded that, even though they agreed that BT had overcharged me for 5 years, BT should nonetheless retain 95% of the wrongly taken money. The new officer had taken less than a day to review all the evidence, in spite of agreeing to talk with me on the phone, refused to listen to any of my points of view.  This was neither a ""Fair and Reasonable"" process nor outcome. My advice after nearly a year of hassle is ""Don't bother with the Ombudsman"". They are weak organisation who won't stand up to BT.  As many others have written, the Ombudsman service is failing the customer and clearly needs urgent change.My response to the Ombudsman Services reply below:The Ombudsman's use of statistics below is wholly misleading. They claim that the Ombudsman ""Upheld over half (52%) of the complaints brought to us in 2018"" However, looking at the facts in my case, the Ombudsman did uphold my claim BUT then only awarded me a derisory 5% of the overcharging done by BT who refuse to repay any more. Therefore statistically, my case was upheld - i.e within the 52% published as upheld by the Ombudsman- but due to the highly unbalanced pro-BT judgement of the officer, BT were allowed to keep 95% of my money wrongly taken from my bank account. Therefore, the financial outcome was that BT WON AND I LOST. However, the statistics quoted by the Ombudsman would incorrectly imply that I won - which is wholly misleading.",Yes,30-Dec-19,"Hello.

Part of their offer was £120 for 3 days when they failed to turn up meaning I had lost 3 days earnings entirely through their incompetence.I regarded £120 for 3 days of lost earnings to be derisory. To my complete astonishment, Ombudsman services withdrew this offer,effectively encouraging npower to continue to treat their customers with contempt.Throughout my dealings with the ombudsman the service was disgraceful. I received my final response from them at 3 minutes past midnight on a Saturday evening. This suggests that I was dealing with an automated service rather than a competent adjudicator.

OVO didn't inform me I would be paying daily charges on the dead and rusty gas meter. They were informed by me from day 1 that the meter DID NOT SUPPLY GAS whatsoever! It was not connected in any way, shape or form to my caravan!  OVO was duty bound to inform me they would be charging me for a  dead, inoperative meter - it was their legal duty to fully inform me of this when I appointed them and TOLD THEM FROM DAY ONE ABOUT THE DEAD METER - OVO instead chose to withhold this critical information and PROFIT from the dead meter. I demanded ALL MY VOICE RECORDINGS from OVO - nope! Still not had them despite the LIE OVO said they had previously emailed them!

United Kingdom,3,1,09-Apr-19,4,2,2019,Insufficient reply to previous comments,"The Ombudsman's reply to my previous review perfectly epitomises the service that I (and many others) have received from them. Firstly, it is a standardised reply that they have used for a number of other comments on this site. The large majority of the communications that I received from them over nine months were also just bureaucratic standardised replies that usually had no relevance to the previous emails and texts that I had sent them. This type of service is thoughtless, lazy and ultimately quite insulting because it shows that they have given no real thought to the issues involved. By just sending standardised, trivial responses it is clear that the Ombudsman service has no real motivation to address the issues raised by their customers and to improve.Secondly, they have completely failed to address the points that I made. When they say that they weigh up the evidence from both sides my point was that they had signally failed to do this because nobody had actually contacted me directly to hear our side of the story. Therefore, their decision was made on information from one side of the dispute. The decision that they arrived at, therefore, was at best insufficient and at worst biased.As regards the above, I was already fully aware of the way that the Ombudsman service is funded. I appreciate that the service receives no government funding and has to make efforts to keep the service free for people making complaints. However, to claim that the money that they get from the Utility firms does not influence their decisions is naive and clearly does not match reality. There is a vast body of research that attests to the covert influence of such funding in a wide range of areas (including medicine, business, social services etc). The organisation receiving the funding will always claim that it does not affect their decisions but research shows that it invariably does. I am aware that for the Ombudsman service to recognise this fact is a challenging one for them. However, without addressing these issues they will continue to receive very poor reviews of their service.",Yes,09-Apr-19,"Hi Roger.

Thanks for the reply, now here is mine. It is the service provider who draws up the contract and makes the promises ""and not Openreach"".

It professes to be in the consumers' interest and yet wholeheartedly ignores what consumers actually tell them about the conduct of industry players that are signed up to them.My case was a very simple case of Domestic and General having wrongly cancelled a boiler care policy (and refusal to cover the cost of a simple repair to my boiler) following receipt of artificially inflated costs from an independent repair agent that had been engaged.  Despite numerous calls and correspondence explaining evidence I had (and sent them) that clearly showed the diagnosis on site was not the same as that later submitted to D&G, they refused to listen, nor even countenance the possibility that costs may have been over-inflated (which would have been to their, or Scottish Power's, detriment if processed), choosing simply to say that they cannot criticise a qualified engineer and what that engineer tells them!  Really!!  Even when they are clearly seeking to fleece you!!!  Absolutely unbelievable and devoid of all common sense or logic!!!!To add salt to injury, my appeal against the decision was dealt with by the same person who had rejected my claim in the first place. Absolutely bizarre!  When I queried this the lame answer was that it is their process and they are able to consider appeals where new information is provided or significant errors that make a material difference can be shown.  Well, guess what?  That made absolutely no difference whatsoever as the same lady simply refused to accept any of my appeal grounds.  When I subsequently wrote to the lady to provide feedback on the flaws in their processes/service, particularly in relation to the appeal being conducted by the same person and the bias and impartiality this causes, this was again met by a flat denial of anything being wrong with the appeal and decision making processes.  I had also asked for my feedback for service improvement to be sent to the appropriate persons within the organisation to be considered. Again, this was not done.

Otherwise, why point that out right at the beginning of your claim.          EVERYBODY WITH A PROVIDER DISPUTE DO START A                               COURT CASE NOW   !!!is the only proven way to make them obsolete and denounce their utter complacency only based on the fact that they make that statement right when you first contacted them.It matters to them It's why they are there beating you around the bush.It must really affect the statistic and reputation concerning energy suppliers or any other kind of supplier somehow colluded with the Ombudsman thugs and con artist employed at this unpleasant organization. THE SIMPLE EXISTENCE OF SUCH AN ORGANIZATION  THAT MAKES A MOCKERY OF THE LAW, IT'S AN INSULT TO SOCIETY.I've been trying to log in to my case portal since Friday and despite two calls with the most unpleasant unhelpful and unreliable operators, they keep stopping me from submitting evidence of fraudulent manipulation of my EDF account by EDF obviously.The latter comes up with a response on my case portal 3 days later I submitted my complaint and before the IT department even unacknowledged my log-in issue (the one I cannot access but somehow found the way to EDF very....very....promptly) and although the 8 weeks period is well and truly gone, been the issue raised in August, they now claim (the ombudsTrools not EDF) that my claim is a totally different related incident and I will have to wait for the 8 weeks period to expire.So the IT department wasn't able to get back to me as a matter of urgency (remember they only give you one hour to log in to the newly filed case after the call, and then stop you from accessing it but EDF got there first. Amazing is like the third guy in Edwardian time supervising a shootout duel giving you a gun with no bullet and sending you off for a not very happy ending.Crafty if not criminal.

And that explains the second disclaimer of ""not tolerating abuse to staff"" given to you when you first called them, together with the ""not going to court"" one, only because they know they will push it so up to your rectum and abuse you in such a skilful and convoluted manner that you are going to lose it no matter what o how hard you try to reason them.I give it to them the softly spoken controlled manner and the overall undermining of your argument it can only be the result of a beautifully crafted induction programme which every OmbudsTrolls follow to the letterTO YOU IT WILL FEEL LIKE HELL WRAPPED IN RAINBOW PAPER.No other company has such a disclaimer during a telephone conversation to my knowledge not even Virgin has such a disclaimer which is well known to do their best to upset the customer.

United Kingdom,1,1,18-Dec-18,12,4,2018,They are an utter waste of space,"They are an utter waste of space, if i could give a zero rating that would not even come close enough in providing an accurate score.. Ombudsman service is a joke, I wasted time and effort trying to describe the utter shambolic mess Npower put me in, to whittle it down despite paying a monthly bill of £240 I was provided a debt with Npower of £3.4k. This was a result of terrible miscommunication from Npower, who provided estimate bills and letters providing wrong bills which caused utter confusion as well as appalling advice provided by there workers on the phone. Npower wilfully allowed me to incur huge debts without providing much information that these debt were accrued because my direct debit (based on there estimates) was barely covering usage.  After coming to an arrangement of paying over £600 a month for almost a year to cover the debt and my current usage i was then told that I could then move to another supplier as I had paid all the outstanding money on my account. After being locked to Npower for soo long this came as a huge relief! However a few months after i had left i was then given a bill of £800!! they had attempted to randomly remove this from the direct debit i set up with them after 4 months of leaving!! I rang them up and told them what the charge was for and they informed it was a debt i had incurred in the last quarter i was with them based on my usage. I protested as they had informed me i was paying towards my usage already and this was a sufficient amount, and secondly they had told me on the exit phone call that i was free to leave as all payment to the account had been settled. There was absolutely no mention of an outstanding fee for usage that had occurred. They lied and said that this was mentioned in the exit call and the exact amount owed was also mentioned. I asked them for the phone transcript and they skirted around the issue saying i would need to request an FOI. At that point i rang the ombudsman who at first seemed very sympathetic to my ordeal and seemed to have understood my anger and concern regarding the bill. After spending numerous hours and working through letters and a timeline with Npower to provide  the evidence needed, the ombudsman said they were investigating the matter. I was waiting on them to ask for further information in their investigations, at least chase up the transcript from the call Npower claim they stated the bill left on the account. The ombudsman didnt think to look into the matter, after a few weeks they came back to me just regurgitating what Npower had feedback, and that I would have to make payment to them, and told me that their offer of reducing the bill by £40 as gesture of goodwill was sufficient, and also to arrange yet another payment plan to pay it back. So they provided nothing to the discussion. I do believe this ombudsman is far from impartial and designed to make you feel like the energy suppliers are indeed being fair and reasonable in regards to their disgusting behaviour. It is a sham and i advise anyone thinking of going down that route not to waste their time and continue giving the energy supplier hell with  their unreasonable money grabbing behaviour. Stay firm in your complaint, if you believe you have been wronged please continue to stand up for yourself until a decent compromise has been established... where next to complain?? its all tactful and complete waste of time.",Yes,18-Dec-18,"Hello.

Not for the customers!!,"What a waste of time it all was. 8 can't help but wonder if the ombudsmen are paid by the companies they're supposed to be keeping in check. The report they sent to me is riddled with innacuracies and lies... From the point of view of the company I'd complained about.It beggars belief and it seems the ombudsman sings from the same hymm sheet as the supplying company. It made no difference what I said and how I could prove it.I'm disgusted. I would use the words chocolate and teapot if I believed they were truly independent, but I don't believe that and it would suggest they actually try and fail. They just take the supplier at their word. Not the customer.Well done ombudsman, who pays your wages and what are you actually for? It seems you're all in it together...... In response to the frankly laughable reply below. Stick your reply where the sun doesn't shine. You really believe I'd waste my oxygen by emailing you? I've already wasted time and energy taking my complaint to you. Instead of browsing all the angry reviewers on here who obviously believe you're in it with the energy cartels, publicly responding in a sycophantic manner so it looks as if you're actually bothered. Let me say that it doesn't affect the negative views in the slightest. We have the measure of you.It's an insult, so don't bother. Maybe you should tell us (honestly!) who pays your wages, I think we know the answer already!Just another quick addition, I have just had no choice but to pay the fine that the energy company placed on my account with the threat of it affecting my credit score if I didn't pay. The fine was for complaining to the ombudsman about them. It just gets better and better.... For the energy companies. Seems they can do what they want and the ombudsman doesn't even abide by its own rules. You want to switch? Well you can, even if you are in debit for a small amount. But if you complain the ombudsman will tell you that you couldn't switch as you were in debit by £24, even though we were in CREDIT by £36. Is it really worth switching when they don't have to stick the the fixed rate they offered you when you did switch? According to the ombudsman they can change the direct debit because they don't have to stick to the agreement. Though other energy companies tell me that they DO have to stick to the agreement otherwise you can leave without a fine. Seems that the ombudsman don't actually know their a*se from their elbow.

It was me who used to call the supplier 3 times a week to resolve the situation but nothing was done. It all started from August 2017. Now that my contract is close to finish, my supplier has come back with a magic bill of almost £4000 and they are claiming that its an actual bill where my meter shows zero for all reading, still now. I had been paying my bills by direct debit for almost two years and the supplier is saying that all those were estimated bills and my actual consumption is higher. Now they are threatening me to pay almost £4000 at a time otherwise they will disconnect the supply. Instead of replacing the meter and giving me an accurate bill where I could see the readings similar to my meter, they have already come twice inside the shop threatening me to pay the bill in full. ""Pay the money or I'll disconnect you"" this is the exact words they use. And when I filed a case in Ombudsman Service and attached all the bills and letters from my supplier, Ombudsman's decided that the suppliers recent bill was right (from a broken meter!!). They asked the supplier to deduct £50 pound (u read it right, £50) to compensate and to send an apology letter. I wonder how an apology would make the supplier feel guilty. I asked Ombudsman to make the penalty big enough that the suppliers would think twice to cause this kind of harassment.

United Kingdom,3,1,30-Nov-18,11,4,2018,Ombudsman acts like the energy suppliers back-office debt department.,"I moved into a building and signed up to a contract with Extra Energy, before I moved in.  Eon would not allow the move as they said the previous tenant owed Eon money. It transpired it was Eon that owed the previous tenant about £5,000. Also, I am not the previous tenant so what this had to do with me I don't know.Eventually after about 1 month, Eon wrote to me saying I could now move to Extra Energy. I contacted Extra Energy and told them, so they made their second application, then the following day without notice or a warrant, Eon turned up to disconnect my supply. They came about 9am and instructed the staff the electricity was going to be cut off and they should turn the gas off, turn the computers off and get their belongings before the power was cut off and the shutters lowered. All my customers on a busy day were cancelled. I arrived within 15 minutes after frantic calls and I had to arrest Eon to stop them. I lost 3 new staff who thought their job was insecure and 3 customers because of the no notice cancellation.Then, Eon said I couldn't move after all. I believe this is common practice and I've heard there is an industry name for it, it's called ""FLUNKING THE MOVE"" it's where they object to the move, drag it out for as long as possible so they can carry on billing for as long as possible. In my case about 6 months - at ""Deemed"" rates! Eon say the supply was ""Deemed"" despite me contracting with Extra Energy from the first day. Then Eon issued a Court summons for the Deemed bill, without notice or warning, or me being given a deadlock letter or being given the option to being referred to the Ombudsman.I contacted the Ombudsman and they agreed to look at this. Then Eon tried everything to try and stop the Ombudsman from investigating.  A manger replied to Eon, he seemed to know his stuff, and shot down every feeble point Eon made, so I was hopeful at first. Now after going through the process I concluded the ombudsman is just after their fee.  After that they are working for the utilities, not the customer.  Everything they say is parroting what Eon said in their irrelevant replies. Eon even lied, as they said my meter was outside so they didn't need a warrant. I sent the ombudsman a photo of the meter which is inside the premises and this was all but ignored, along with all the other proof and documents.The Ombudsman has found in Eons favour, agreed Eons bill, agreed Eons viewpoint and ignored that I was contracted with another supplier at much cheaper rates. ignored Eons lies, ignored all the proof I gave them and ignored Eon's illegal disconnection without a warrant.The Ombudsman is a waste of time and in my opinion they are worse than “not fit for purpose” they appear to be in cahoots with the energy supplier (with matey phone calls and emails between them). Sadly, the Ombudsman act like the energy suppliers  back-office debt department, after-all it's Eon paying them, isn't it. If you want to avoid months of stress, months of writing, months of despair then AVOID AVOID AVOID. The only useful thing is, the Ombudsman takes months and puts the account on hold. You can also ask for all letters, notes, records, telephone calls that Eons has under GDPR. It's free. Also those between Eon and the Ombudsman which is a revelation as how they work) so use them for that, and for breathing space and get a solicitor to sue the utilities in the Court or issue yourself online (google MCOL) where you will find a friendly judge to listen to you - that's if they turn up. I hear often they don't and you win by default.You will get about 3 emails, one a month from the Ombudsman saying ""Decision Published. Don't panic, It hasn't.  All that has happened is they have disregard your complaint and condensed the energy companies feeble arguments and passed it off the ombudsman decision for your response. It's a waste of time, no matter what proof you send in, they keep repeating the same stuff over and over. I'd say it's designed to dis-hearten you, so you accept the original offer made by the energy company. I wager this is what you will find too that the Ombudsman recommends Eons deadlock offer as the ombudsman ""final decision"".EDIT:I see I got a reply from the social ombudsman within hours. I have immediately sent the information requested. Am I wasting my time? I'll let you knowEDIT: 6th NovemberI find the ombudsman service has complained about this review...for apparently breaching GDPR. I will edit it if if TrustPilot inform me of what the alleged breach is. (The breach was that I named the Ombudsman that first appeared competent, they suggest this puts them at risk of reprisals).EDIT: 11 December 2018 Still no word or acknowledgement from the Social Ombudsman that said ""Hi Chris. We would like to look into this for you""  More lies? It seems a waste of my time emailing the Social Ombudsman as they as requested on here. EDIT: 12 December 2018Today I have reviewed 1 tape of 3 telephone recordings between the Ombudsman and Eon (I asked for all recordings under GDPR at the start. This arrived a week before her final decision was due. In the tape, Eon day the Ombudsman ""Hello love"", they are very matey indeed. No impartiality. Eon then apologise for putting her to extra work on this case. She assures them ...this is what she is there for (like a secretary, eager to please her boss).Later on she blatantly helps to conceal an important issue. The Ombudsman appears to coach Eon on what to say in their reply.  Even after Eon tell her the truth, twice, she then tells Eon if they write what she suggested, she will condense that into her ""final decision"" and send it out to me.My suspicion seems founded. It appears the Ombudsman not only acts like the Energy company's back office secretary, they actively connive against the customer.I have today asked for this Ombudsman Miss N. N. to disqualify herself for unprofessional conduct, to refer herself for investigation and to pass it back to the Manager Mr J. G. (Yes the first manager that took this on.(I looked him up on Linked In, he's from Liverpool. This is the same one that didn't want to be named for risk of being identified. Lets see if he redeems himself, or is like the rest. I'll let you know).EDIT: 13 December.I told you I wrote to the Ombudsman (on 12th) I sent a transcript of the relevant conversation she had with Eon. I asked the Ombudsman about 20 questions asking for explanations, on her partiality. I pointed out the admissions Eon made in the recording, which validated my complaint. I highlighted her apparent leading and coaching of Eon's answers to her, so she could then dismiss complaint. Today I  got a response. Nothing from Mr J. G and no answers to any of my 20 questions. While acknowledging my letter of the 12th,  she said her final decision is the same as Eons deadlock letter, but it's not binding if I don't agree with it.H-E-L-L-O .... I didn't agree with it when I made the complaint to the Ombudsman. Why would I agree with it now that I have further proof from the tape recordings, with Eon's admission and with photographic proof Eon are lying?I think there needs to be a full investigation of the Ombudsman service in the UK. I see 89% dissatisfaction rate on here alone. One would be safe in thinking that the reason people complain is because they have a serious grievance. If theirs is anything like mine, then I doubt 89 out of 100 are invalid complaints. With such a pitiful score, I think ALL the Ombudsman files should be taken off them and reviewed by a panel of solicitors to ascertain the legality and validity of the complaints they have handled.  If it's found the Ombudsman has been acting in bad faith then there needs to be jail time for the top people who orchestrate this con on us, with full compensation like PPI. We seem to live in a rip-off country at the moment and the Ombudsman service seem to be there to help them rip us off.",Yes,30-Nov-18,"Hi Chris. We would like to look into this for you.

United Kingdom,29,1,15-Nov-18,11,4,2018,Ombudsman are a utter joke stay away!!!,"This is my second encounter with the ombudsman in just over a few months, although they resolved my 1st problem its had to be ongoing.Currently fighting with Vodafone over a faulty handset which allegedly did get resolved, well the resolution itself was a right mess, my handset was replaced by a different one in which I requested but guess what? It was faulty from the start.Has I live 40 miles away from the nearest store plus a toll bridge I found this trip very tiring has I am a disabled vulnerable adult.Over the last 5 months I have been constantly lied too by Vodafone, they have not documented anything either so basically I am called a lier.Well contacted ombudsman for them to patronise me with a very early morning call which awoke me suddenly, to be promised the said 	investigating officer Chris Miller was to call back straight away as soon has he returned on monday,that eventually came on wednesday.His version of a resolution is contradictory to say the least I feel he has not done his job properly at all.Now he is telling me that no matter how much I complain his decision stays.talk about victimisation or what!!!No apology for not returning calls either.So who the hell do we turn too when they fail too. Has this matter has gone on for far too long I am not putting up with it, no one seems to care this day n age so long has there collecting their paper at the end of the week/month there ok screw everyone else.Very angry indeed not a reliable source at all stay away if you have any sense!!!",Yes,15-Nov-18,"Hello.

United Kingdom,5,1,11-Oct-18,10,4,2018,I have a case,"I have a case where the meter reader last year was drunk and did not know what a meter reader was. We have good reason to believe that he was part of the G4S investigation services called the Cotswold Group, as the police had just warned these thugs to keep away from us. They had been harassing us claiming someone unknown to us lived at our address.They turned up at 8am on a Saturday claiming falsely that a man had arranged for them to visit. The man threatened my wife and I with violence, when we told him to sling his hook.Two more G4S/ Cotswold thugs turned up two weeks later and the police warned them under the Protection from Harasment act. This Morrisons data service (MDS) guy, who are part of G4S/ Cotswolds conglomerate, was dressed like these thugs, not in the correct uniform. He was arrogant not like a ""cor Blimey"" meter reader but a like a police or army officer. He was very overweight and old, more like a company executive. He could not identify any meter and we had to point them out for him. He covered up his ID badge and was waving his gadget around as if filming.He was sweating profusely and my son and I looked at each other in wonder. He then ran out of the house in sheer panic. He wrecked our front door and drove away fast in a plush BMW as per G4S vehicles not an MDS vehicle.We complained to EON and MDS but, of course were obstructed and white washed all the way. Eon, nine months later told us to go to the ombudsman; this we did, Ha Ha!!!We found, by this meter reading, nine months later, that we were some £1,000 in debt to Eon; I paid it off . The evidence from Eon was made available through a data access request (SDAR) The OS firstly sent it through a format that my computer could not handle and I requested hard copies. The ruling from the OS was that Eon/MDS had made frequent visits to my home but they were denied access, as per the evidence supplied (they did not). The OS claimed thus:Therefore I do not consider the backbilling principle of the Code applies. The Code also does not apply for the period 7 March 2016 until 5 September 2017 because the company has provided evidence that it attempted to read your meter on a number of occasions between these dates but could not gain access to the meters. I asked to see the said evidence of this, dates times of these visits etc, as I am in most days and saw nobody, many times and they refused to supply the evidence.I needed to see any evidence that my energy usage had/or not risen by £1,000 in nine months, as this cleared them of the one year ruling where these debts are wiped off. I asked to see this evidence upon receipt of the SDAR as it was not included in the package. They still refuse to supply this evidenceThe evidence that was provided shows that my gas meter was read every three months but somehow the electricity meter was not. Despite the myth that if we had any questions just ask; this I did. Here is the responseAs above the OS complained that I used their personal data etc, I amended it so Mr X is not his real name or mine.Dear Mr XXXXThank you for your email.I note you have raised a number of questions.The deadline to provide your response to the initial findings has expired. This time period is generally NOT extended so that customers can review evidence as part of DPA or exchange of evidence requests. However, in this case I have allowed you to review these before you provide representations.You now state that you would like answers to some questions in your email below, before you submit your final representations.Let me be very clear when I state you must provide ALL representations before 5pm on 12 October 2018. I will respond to the representations you have raised in your email below and any further representations you raise, in my Ombudsman Services Decision, which I will issue after the 5pm deadline on 12 October 2018.If you fail to provide any further representations then I will issue my final decision after 5pm on 12 October 2018, while addressing any queries you have raised up to that point.This is a very strict process and is non-negotiable.I look forward to hearing from you.RegardsXXXX XXXXInvestigations OfficerMr XXXX XXXX refused to supply this evidence instead making a threatening response to have all my evidence send by tomorrow evening.This is an offence under the DPA and obviously an attempt to cover up for their paymasters Eon. I made a complaint to the CEO of the OS regarding the DPA, unsurprisingly, no  reply as yet.This OS obviously thinks that it is above the law of the land. This outfit should not be trusted and everyone should avoid them at all costs. they are not fit for purpose.I will update when the final decision is made by themI received a further email from the OS after this review was postedHi Mr XXXXSomeone will be in touch shortly to discuss this with you further.Thank you for getting in touch.RegardsOh yes, thank you OS, I amended the post; it does not contain any personal information now!! No response as yet; shall I hold my breath?I am now looking at raising a petition to Parliament to close this outfit down and  replace it with an independent body; see how it goes",Yes,11-Oct-18,Hello and thank you for your review.

United Kingdom,2,5,19-Mar-19,3,1,2019,Online Portal is Intuitive & Resolved My Compliant with Energy Supplier,"Their complaints portal was intuitive and easy to use, with steps clearly laid out. Officially articulating the problem on their site, adding appropriate evidence, prompted the energy company to take me more seriously. I was promptly contacted by a Ombudsman Liason manager from the energy company, and a resolution quickly reached. This was then formally agreed on the portal, through relevant input from the energy company.Though the Ombudsman people didn't need to actively step in in this case, all in all, they provided a good, easy to use portal, which solved the issue. I just wish I'd used this method to complain from the get-go, rather than spend months incessantly dealing directly with the energy company, debt collection agencies etc.!",Yes,19-Mar-19,Hello.

I didn't have any debt so all the money I had paid them I was due a refund. Scottish power agreed but failed to follow through with my refund. After a couple of months I turned to the energy ombudsman and after about 6 weeks a descion has been made in my favour plus a goodwill payment has been implemented. My process was very simple and easy and fairly fast. Using the online portal is very easy and it shows everything laid out. Scottish power now have 28 days to pay me the goodwill gesture and the money owed from the incorrect debt and to send a apology letter.

They resolved my dispute with my energy provider, which went in my favour, but even if if had not I would still have been very pleased with their service as honest broker.

United Kingdom,15,5,10-Dec-21,12,4,2021,A fair and unbiased service in my opinion.,"I was unexpectedly refunded over £500 pounds to my energy account when I complained that I wasn't getting any monthly statements. They explained this was due to back billing issues, and I was told my account was up to date. However the energy supplier clawed this back without notice or explanation six months later, sending my account into debit. I complained and couldn't get a satisfactory resolution or explanation. So I took my complaint to the energy ombudsman. Although this part of the complaint was not upheld because I had been paying all the way through, more than enough, and the final statement after the clawback was in fact correct, the poor customer service aspect was upheld, and the ombudsman ordered the compensation to be paid, which it then was.I was treated with respect and dignity during this process, and even if your complaint isn't upheld, or only upheld in part, my experience is that they will tell you how they came to their decision, in a way you can understand and appreciate, which is all I was hoping for, from my energy supplier.  In my case I do believe their decision was fair, and the whole of it (including the parts which where not upheld) were concisely explained to me, and any questions I had were accurately answered during a telephone conversation.I have no hesitation in recommending their service if you are in a dispute with your energy supplier. At least you will get to know exactly why things might be as they are, even if your dispute is ultimately not upheld.",Yes,10-Dec-21,"Hi Shaun, thanks for leaving such a fantastic review!

Would that they had had the goodwill to engage with me properly in the first place and save me months of going backwards and forwards … but there we are, I clearly do not have the power of the Ombudsman!",Yes,09-Dec-21,"Hi Anna, It sounds like you had a really frustrating time with your supplier.

Finally after a long, very stressful struggle we managed to get them to change our very old Siemens meter. Words cant describe the nightmare to get this far. It confirmed what we had long suspected that we were being charged for the power we were using and the power being generated by our solar panels from the FIT meter ( supplied by a different energy supplier) This ran into an overcharge of £1k,s of pounds Having established this and proved it beyond doubt,  we naively thought we would receive an apology and reimbursement from Scottish Power. This was not forthcoming and the whole thing just wasn't getting anywhere, right back to the beginning again. We asked the Ombudsman for their assistance, we sent them our evidence, once they received it they took up the case and we are pleased to say that they have obtained our refund in full, plus compensation for the costs we incurred. We believe that without their help we wouldn't have got this result and cant thank them enough. The only problem we are left with is that the smart meter that Scottish Power installed doesn't work as it should, apparently the walls in our house are to thick? and you have to go outdoors to read the meter.",Yes,08-Jul-21,"Hi Ray, it sounds like you had to go round in a lot of circles with your complaint.

British gas lied and had been caught out phone call recordings, emails, texts and letters proving at fault.I had to go to the ombudsman to stop 3 debt collection agency's. The process takes time you have to make the complaint direct to the company then you make note of the date. Then contact ombudsman on the 8th week to start the process. It takes time but thats how it works then a further 1 to 2 months to investigate and time for both sides to respond. So many people on here complaining but thats how the process works. So unless you do this just like the court of law your evidence will mean nothing until you go through the correct way. I won the cases and british gas is one company me, family and friends will never use again there service is shocking and disgusting they do not care and just to to bully and pressure you in to paying bills that are not yours.I won due to the help from the ombudsman and it soon sorted out british gas who didnt have a foot to stand on.",Yes,20-May-21,"Hi Peter, thank you for leaving us such a great review.

I thought the Ombudsman's service was professional, thorough and timely and would recommend them to anyone having issues with these companies. If I was to offer any advice when dealing with these energy companies, put everything in writing on emails and when it comes to providing evidence to the Ombudsman, you just need to pull those up and it's timed, dated and shows every detail of your complaint and the responses, or lack of them from the energy company.

They will only parrot what the energy provider says. If your service provider offers you compensation take their second offer. If you are with Octopus on a smart meter you will know they cannot bill you on time and if they cant bill you at all they will apply their high variable tariff - this can apply for months. Its an unfair term with their reward for failing to provide a service but charging you sky high tariff and not the tariff you signed up for. The ombudsman thinks thats fair and says its not the energy providers fault for failing to provide a service -its the 'beta' service excuse. Noone is responsible so the customer is charged over the odds.

United Kingdom,18,1,17-Dec-21,12,4,2021,Entirely in bed with the energy…,"Entirely in bed with the energy providers - create the illusion of a 'process' with the sole goal of frustrating you, the customer, whose full time job is not to fight this (whereas their full time job is). Did you experience a run-around with your energy provider, attempts by them to claim the process had been resolved and making you do all the work while they sent email after email attempting to shut the process down?Well, this is the Energy Ombudman's playbook too. You are dealing with people who are being paid to deal with your dispute, and have no incentive to resolve it accurately or appropriately. You, the customer, are not being paid to resolve it, and so for you time and your own energy to deal with it are limited commodities.They know this and they use this to their advantage, by creating processes that look like they follow a fair procedure, but actually are entirely geared toward an industry-friendly outcome - which by that point you will accept because you have already invested hundreds of hours beating your head against a wall trying to get a resolution.Edit: an Energy Ombudsman employee (on full salary and pension, unlike us, the customer) has just replied in their usual procedural manner, solicitously offering to clear up any confusion I may have about how they handled my case. This reply from an Ombudsman employee kind of sums it up. They have all the time in the world to dress up a ""due process"" and on the surface it looks consumer friendly. But what are the actual remedies they implement, and are customers (who will already have been victimised by the energy companies, in many cases) actually treated fairly in the end? Does the Energy Ombudsman work for consumers, or industry?A look through the reviews here tells a pretty clear story - the plurality give one star, and many are desperate and angry.Look under the hood of the solicitous verbiage at the actual rulings, and you'll find evidence that the Energy Ombudsman serves the gas and electricity companies by making it look like consumers have recourse - the EO doesn't actually serve consumers. Look at the actual rulings (by perusing people's actual testimony here) and you'll see the Energy Ombudsman's remedies stink, their knowledge of the law is non-existent, their willingness to look at evidence thoroughly is lacking, and their end results - frankly corrupt.  You're better off going straight to small claims court than deal with these paid shills.After 3 years of nonsense by BG, them closing my account because someone else in my apartment building closed theirs and they mistook the address,  7 separate instances of them failing to record my metre readings when I (or in one case, their own paid contractor) recorded them, BG misspelling my email address and then claiming I had not responded to correspondence I never received, BG incorrectly applying thousands of pounds of electricity and gas usage that never occurred (because they repeatedly failed to record my metre readings provided) - after all that, the corrupt Energy Ombudsman offered a resolution of £100 odd pounds. I am a successful business person with a first class degree from a good university. Even I was so worn down, demoralised and dehumanised by this process that eventually I just accepted the Ombudsman's ludicrous settlement. This is how institutions, who pay full time employees to make customers lives miserable, use ""processes"" to grind you down.This is corruption and dishonesty.",Yes,17-Dec-21,"Hello, thank you for taking the time to leave your review.

Although the ombudsman service appeared to be competent (if rather slow) I am still no further forward.  It is virtually impossible to get through to anyone in SSE so I can't follow this up.

Had I known that there was just a 3 in 10 chance of a satisfactory outcome by taking my case to them, I would not have bothered. Even my untrained eye would have concluded that 7 out of 10 cases they fail to satisfy, cannot have been taken to them just for the fun of it, but because consumers are genuinely aggrieved.

This complaint has been going on since Feb 2020.The offer of £50 compensation for bad customer service,  I have refused, and requested they use it for staff training.

Goodwill payment of £100 (to the energy account I don't have anymore, I'm now with Octopus) what's the point of that? What about a goodwill payment to me for the hell you've put me through.

When I made my complaint to the Ombudsman about BT, nobody told me that Openreach is not covered by the scheme, even though Openreach is a very significant profit contributor to the BT Group; I am sure the shareholders don't worry where their profits come from. The Ombudsman upheld my complaint about the lack of connection but there is nothing that can be done, as work has to be done by Openreach's subcontractor Telent, who are even less accountable.

The fact that a customer has had to spend time pursuing their complaint or is upset by something that has happened is not in itself a reason for an award. We will only require an award when the business has caused significant distress and/or inconvenience.

The investigating officer showed a poor level of competence, failing to investigate key aspects of the complaint and issued a decision that blatantly contradicted facts about the case provided by the supplier. When questioned the investigating officer stated that the facts were irrelevant. Her words not mine. The appeals process was a joke as the system did not allow additional evidence to be provided. Furthermore, as a result of the decision it is possible the service has permitted the electrical supplier to commit a criminal offence.

Only now, they hide behind Ombudsman ""process"" since they do not have to respond until 30 August '21.  Been dragging on since late April '21 here. Still no refund, no apology, no good will payment. TE hid behind excuses of ""billing complexities"". Ombudsman hide behind their ""process"". And the Govt sit back and watch with total disdain.UPDATE: 23 Aug 21 - I received a call from a nice chap at Ombudsman who very politely explained their positioning here, limitations, powers and alternatives.  I have raised my rating from 1 to 4 now, following this call as in fairness, I was letting my frustrations with TE cloud my initial judgement here.  I do think though there is still room for improvement with Ombudsman processes. Especially in taking a more aggressive stance with exceptionally poor performers (such as TE) who make a mockery of their customers who expect a reasonable level of service.",Yes,11-Aug-21,"Hi Mike, We are sorry you feel that way. As per the OFGEM guidelines, you have to allow the supplier 8 weeks to resolve the complaint via their own complaint handling procedures before you can refer the case to us. Alternatively, they may issue a deadlock letter prior to the 8 weeks if they a mutually agreeable solution will not be reached. Our process allows both parties the opportunity to submit information and evidence relating to the case and whilst we understand that the complaint process can feel like it takes a long time, we appreciate our consumers patience as this allows us to fully investigate the situation and establish a fair resolution. During this time, the provider may offer an 'early resolution' proposal however, if you choose not to agree to this then the full investigation will be completed. You are able to check where your case is up to via your online account and should you need anything from us while the investigation is underway then please don't hesitate to contact us. Thank you",0
United Kingdom,1,1,11-Aug-21,8,3,2021,Complete failure of service,"From start to finish the service was poor beyond the ability of this review description. Rude staff who after 6 months wait for a response, told me I had a 7 day deadline to collect and submit 18 months worth or email and correspondence for evidence. When spoken to another manager, they apologised and gave me a more reasonable deadline that they then failed to stick to and issued a decision 4 days before the deadline for my evidence submission. Was then ignored and told ,y only option was to appeal. Once the decision was appealed, they failed to even read through this properly and issued a final decision that made no sense and was littered with a comedy of errors. Even the company I was in conflict with laughed at their outcome. It is lucky I managed to resolve the complaint with HUGE success after 18 months of hard work directly with the company who admitted full liability. If this would not have been the case i would be going to court right now! This is how serious the complaint was. I wold like to stress, as a small business owner, surviving a pandemic and having this additional stress severely affected my mental health. The Ombudsman and its entire process is a failed public service. I feel so so very sorry for anyone else who may find themselves in my position and have to rely on this company for help. It has to be desperate for companies to seek Ombudsman advice in the first place and it is devastating when you are not only met with rude staff, but a completely poorly managed and incompetent work force who have no empathy or ethics.

Three customer services were unable to help, and eventually reached a ""goodwill gesture"" offer of £100, so I asked to refer it to the ombudsman.I raised the issue with the ombudsman service, and Three were then quick to see the problem, and within a couple of weeks offered me the full refund I was asking for (they updated the amount to include the time since I raised the complaint, so actually offered around £330), and an apology letter.I didn't get any compensation for my time/energy, but this wasn't what I was really after.... I just wanted back what was mine, that they should never have had (although some kind of compensation for the inconvenience would have been appreciated).Without going to the Ombudsman Service, I would never have received this full amount, so I can say that in my case, it worked as it should.The website is a little clunky to use, but I had no real trouble with it, and it only took me about 20 minutes to raise my complaint.I would recommend everyone who is having problems with their suppliers (when the resolutions being offered are inadequate) to not be afraid to go to the ombudsman.",Yes,03-Aug-21,"Hi Ian, its fantastic that you got a speedy resolution to your complaint with Three.

United Kingdom,8,1,30-Jun-21,6,2,2021,Extremely disappointing and not recommended,"Extremely disappointed with how this service operates. It felt as though they are paid by the companies as a bonus if they find a way not to address the issue correctly with the customer or pay out anything to the customer. I took a deal with BT, they didn’t stick to the deal. Meant to have sent a £150 gift card. I never received it and they know I didn’t activate it as they have record of it. I chased it up and didn’t get anything, went into hospital and was very unwell, when I was out I chased it again. They wouldnt send another one. I spoke to some person on  the phone was patronising and rude. I sent it to the ombudsman service and they decide that their behaviour and not issuing part of the deal I signed up to was okay and offered £20 for the way I was dealt with. I didn’t want anything for that, all I wanted was the money they agreed. If it had been the other way around they would have been sending debt letters threatening me but because it is me that loses out BT and the ombudsman service don’t care. The ombudsman service is there to consider matters independently, a voice, an aid, a representative for the consumer…if this is how they deal with things then as usual companies get away with doing what they like without consequences. I cannot wait to be able to leave BT, service is appalling and wouldn’t recommend to my worst enemy, I don’t think I will waste time and effort with the ombudsman again given the lack of support and terrible investigations  they provide for consumers.

Also the length of time given to the companys to resolve rulings issued is to be laughed at. On the present timescale I will be lucky to have any resolution by July.

They stated that my problem, smart meter issues, was industry wide and work was ongoing with no time scale for a solution.  These smart meters, advertised to save money, are still being advertised and installed, although based on my experience, they are of no value to the consumer, merely a money saver for the suppliers.  A problem which has now taken nearly 6 months, with still no signs of resolution, suggests to me that nobody is trying very hard.

If only you attended to cases so diligently…,"This is the second time you have asked me!  This is very irritating.  Please see my previous response where I wrote why I give OS the lowest possible score.  The service is totally opaque and  my experience is that crucial data have been ignored as the ‘investigation’ leans over backwards to favour the company & devalues the consumers value and publishes no objective criteria to assess its decision or award.  No wonder BT & others continue to give such awful service - there is no incentive to change.  In total contrast CISAS are open & transparent and give the consumer a 4pp guide showing how awards are assessed & typical amounts.  Why does OS not do this?  Obviously because then it’s far easier to be sloppy & hide behind subjectivity like “an average £30 award”.  This is a total failure.  No one seeks ‘punishment’ just fair and adequate compensation for failed services, bullying, gross GDPR breaches etc etc.   No wonder BT choose OS over CISAS.  This needs to be reviewed by the regulator & parliament.  OS is self serving.  Moreover it was late in the decision, which was no doubt also rushed, but can easily be blamed on Covid.  The ‘decision’ was accepted under duress life is too short twhen it is obvious any appeal or complaint will fall on deaf ears and be a further waste of time.

We understand that dealing with complaints can feel like a lengthy process, but we have to allow a supplier 8 weeks to resolve the complaint via their own complaints handling procedure before we get involved.

United Kingdom,1,1,07-May-21,5,2,2021,An absolute waste of time,"An absolute waste of time. This is the second time I've been forced to use their services, and the second time the case has been found in my favour. Both times the case was closed shortly after, with no agreed resolutions implemented by the company. Both themselves and Ofgem refuse to enforce any of the legal obligations energy companies have. Only useful if you want to make an already stressful situation worse. You'd be better off spending the many hours you would waste, getting a second job, to pay off the unlawful extra billings and missed compensation!!Added after the Ombudsmans response: all the ""evidence"" you seek, is a letter from the company stating they will implement the resolutions. Both times the energy company has failed to act on the resolutions in the letter, therefore your evidence of implementation is useless. My last complaint went 4 months with zero enforcement of the resolutions, despite escalating the case. The company then went bankrupt and I lost all monies due to me. This time I can't even escalate the case, as you've closed it (and I can assure you there is no evidence of resolution, as none of the agreed resolutions have happened)",Yes,07-May-21,"Hi Katie, We are sorry that you weren't happy with your experience when using our services.

I won't go into to much detail as it would take dozens of pages so I will just give a couple of examples.1 Sent a bully boy round to threaten me.2.Forced me to take my dying wife,as I could not find anyone to look after her, to a court a very long way away on a freezing cold day and then didn't turn up.The so called ombudsman obviously spent a very long time liaising with E-ON and not with me and found for them. I asked the Ombudsman to let me know under the freedom of information act how many of their employees had previously worked for energy suppliers but was told the act didn't apply to them!I wish somebody would set up a web site dedicated to fighting back and I would myself and am actively looking for help with this.One final remark - One of E-ON's staff who would phone continuously asking for money as is their way of intimidating us, when told I was contacting the Ombudsman, laughed to so long that I had to put the phone down.

United Kingdom,7,2,27-Sep-24,9,3,2024,Energy Ombudsman  Experience,"I opened the Enery Ombudsman  complaint process to establish just what I was required to complete and it immediately asked for specific times and dates which needed extensive research which I was only in the process of completing. I did not have everything at hand to attach documents of proof etc. Once I had entered the complaint I did not know if I could exit at any point and re-enter later. I found it confusing to navigate after initial entry. So I continued to enter details of the complaint off the top of my head. Only after completing this initial stage and submitting that document am I told I can add additional evidence at a later stage. 2. I received an email towards the end of the process after I asked for an explanation regarding the decision made by the case handler. The email stated, ""click here to view the new message""This opened my complaint, and clicked on MESSAGES,     NO new message listed.  Eventually I found the message attached to the enquiry I had sent. NOT very user friendly and certainly confusing.The case handler needs to consider he is dealing with a layman who is unfamiliar territory, this is the first encounter a complainant has had with his system, that he is working on day in day out. Some questions I asked I did not fully understand the complexities that were involved in forming his decision. ie,Found this hard going as an explanation to a layman.In regard to your 6th point, ‘we’ is the Energy Ombudsman. The paragraph is pretty self-explanatory and it generic to all our (the Energy Ombudsman) decisions. There is nothing within the remedies within your decision that British Gas as set out in the remedies. An example of something it may not be able to do is rebill historic usage from an old system, therefore, we would accept it applying a credit to offset any difference. However, this would/does not affect you. No allowance for an appropriate adult who is looking after the account of an elderly person who is without online access to your complaint system.Sorry, but it still reads a double dutch!With regard his last sentence above, my answer is WHY is there no allowance?Appears to me you have one hand tied behind your back and no teeth.This complaint would not have seen the light of day if I had not been fully committed and Mr C, 94 and his wife 92 yrs, with no internet, no email, no mobile phone would have lost out to incompetent British Gas accounting.My time is into days not just hours, all because of the incompetence of British Gas I do not consider that to be an even deal. You have found British Gas liable, Mr C  could not have completed this task and would have lost out if I had not taken this onboard.",Yes,02-Oct-24,"Hello David , we're sorry to hear that you have not had a positive experience when using our services.

United Kingdom,7,2,07-Dec-23,12,4,2023,Not fit for purpose,"The final outcome was OKish. However, the journey there was unnecessarily difficult. My supplier EDF had adversely re-calenderised my bill subsequent to the complaint being made. This would have cost me an additional £500. This appeared to me to be deliberate and felt like they were attempting to victimise me for making a complaint. The initial adjudicator missed the adverse re-calenderisation and made an initial decision. I pointed out that they had missed the adverse re-calenderisation  which had been in my submission. To be fair, the adjucator then realised and acknowledge their error but then pressured me to appeal the decision on the basis of factual error made by the supplier rather than appealing on the omission made by the adjucator. The appeal was succesful and the adjuication was about right with the exception of the good will gesture which was inadequate. The apology received from the supplier was inadequate and failed to acknowledge their attempt to victimise me by increasing my bill further subsequent to raising the complaint. Looking through their annual report and the reviews here, it feels like that some suppliers have been allowed to walk all over the energy ombudsman. It appears that the onerous process to submit a complaint is too heavily weighted in favour of the suppler rather than than the consumer. I am left wondering whether the contract for the Energy Obudsman might be better awarded to another company where the management was strong enough to stand up to poorest behaving suppliers and deliver a fair outcome each and every time, first time.",Yes,12-Dec-23,"Hello Colin, we're sorry to hear that you have not had a positive experience when using our services and that certain elements of your dispute were missed on the first occasion.

From memory the system  asked me if they were new facts I was submitting. A little confused I said no, what is a ""new"" fact, to which the system said that if they were not new facts the options then became accept the decision or decline the decision, no going back to the 3rd option of Appeal.Being new to the process I am upset that I did not have the option to page back and correct my mistake. Whilst I would regard myself as pretty internet savvy I have never experienced an online site that does not allow you to go back and change your choice. Perhaps they are worried about people playing the system but that was not true in my case.I emailed the case handler directly, and he did not answer my points but said I had now missed my opportunity. I do not bear a grudge as I fully understand that they can not be bogged down with backwards and forward communications but I do not feel that my points were answered nor did I get a full hearing as I selected a wrong option and there is no going back.",Yes,17-Apr-23,"Hi Rob, we are sorry that you have not had a positive experience when using our service.

I feel the judgement was fair.One area of improvement for the online tool: the majority of evidence I had pertaining to the case were emails between myself and E.ON.

I phoned them they will have it recorded. I was given a cheaper Tariff,but no mention of if I change to it I will no be paying my usual payment method of in full monthly billing. By luck I noticed it was set in July Sumner month at £155 when my use was £99 . A recent Summer Bill up £30 on the previous month. Querying it the reason was used more fuel. Later it was An Advisor who did a reversal on my past billing . I constantly receive incorrect information  This happened regularly.  As clearly it also occurred with their Smart meter customers issues noted on The One Show last week via Watchdog complaints. Refusal giving people their credit.

United Kingdom,12,1,24-Jul-24,7,3,2024,Upheld but little recompense,"I approached the Ombudsman because my energy provider increased my monthly budget from around £150 to £1550 a month from October 2023. I told the energy company I believed the meter to be faulty and I advised them, as well as sent them, photographic evidence proving this to be true - but they insisted upon an engineer attending, at my cost. Even on the readings from the faulty meter, actual consumption was half the amount demanded each month. Despite the fact that I told my energy supplier that the business could not possibly afford that monthly budget, they persisted in their demands. This stripped away all the business's cash reserves, a bar/bed & breakfast, directly preventing me from opening two of the three rooms I planned - and needed - to open in Spring 2024. In turn, at least £25,000 of losses resulted from the inability to open those rooms. My complaint was dealt with reasonably quickly, efficiently and was also upheld, but the amount the Ombudsman ordered my energy company to pay me for their failings and poor handling of my case was just £100, plus a letter of apology. It appears that an energy provider deliberately driving a company out of business in such a fashion isn't something the industry regulator concerns itself with and therefore, condones. Going to law, which I certainly cannot afford now, seems the only realistic option - but then, what is the purpose of having a regulator if not to challenge and properly punish an energy provider when so clearly at fault?",Yes,29-Jul-24,"Hello Peter, we're sorry that you haven't had a positive experience when using our services.

United Kingdom,8,1,11-Jan-24,1,1,2024,Beware of any change in Energy Ombudsman personnel handling your case.,"The Ombudsman Review went well up to the point of decision. A decision in our favour with 7 resolutions for British Gas to comply with. Currently 1 out of 7 resolutions have been met.British Gas has throughout, from complaint to decision to implementation, prevaricated, deviated, missed deadlines and, apparently without notifying the case handlers wrote directly to me saying that they cannot meet some of the resolutions. This has produced a mountain of correspondence. The current Energy Ombudsman personnel involved are refusing to take  on board the correspondence generated or review the original complaint and decision document.      Unfortunately,  the original case handler went sick and left the organisation - just as matters were drawing to conclusion. At this point two new case handlers were appointed and a coach manager stepped in and new interpretations of what the resolutions meant, were suddenly being given. Interpretations that had never previously been given to me. The second case handler, clearly had not read up on the complaint or what the decision was based on. He unprofessionally criticised his colleagues stating that the resolutions had not been written within protocols and went on to say he was sympathetic to British Gas. Clearly this was unacceptable to me and I asked that he be removed from the case. This happened.A new third case handler was appointed. And as I had with the original case handler sent copies of email correspondence to her. There was a reaction. She demanded to know how I got her email address, she totally ignored the content of the email. An email dealing with a prime sticking point. I obtained her email address by phoning the organisation direct and later learned that case handler's business emails and addresses are freely available. The British Gas email correspondence continued and I sent the case handler copies. This was the response: -'Please can you refrain from copying the Energy Ombudsman into the emails addressed to British Gas. We are no longer investigating your case, and these emails will not be retained'.I bought this to the attention to Ombudsman Customer Service. And received a call from a coach-manager. The subsequent telephone conversation was fraught. It went in to a nowhere argument regarding what various resolutions meant. Again, he like his colleagues appeared to have to have no background knowledge of the case. He outrightly reused to review the complaint saying it was not procedure. What became apparent was the new case handler appointments and manager were making their own personal interpretations without reviewing the case and basing their views on facts. He said that provided British Gas showed intention the resolution was met.There was an outcome from this. The manager persuaded British Gas to make outstanding payments - not yet received. And, on a major sticking point, accepted that British Gas would not charge whatever the outcome for a meter accuracy test. Later confirmed by British Gas. Given that the smart meter is only one year old and an accuracy test was carried out at the time of instalment, and the test would be carried out by a British Gas operative; therefore, not independent we were sceptical. We also believed that we should not be charged for a solution that British Gas put forward by them for a resolution.On research we discovered the Government Office for Product Safety and Standards (OPSS). They are responsible for ensuring that the requirements in the Electricity Act 1989 with respect to the accuracy of meters are met by suppliers and distributors.In contacting them they expressed concerns over the metering issues. They informed us that we had the right to ask for an independent investigation of the meter - this is free. And to ask British Gas to organise such.  The condition being that if the meter is faulty there is no charge, if the meter is working correctly we may have to pay British Gas for organising it. On the face of it this should be no more that what British Gas would charge for carrying out their own accuracy testing.At no time did British Gas or the Energy Ombudsman put this option to us.For us this means we get an independent determination  as to if the smart meter is the cause of the unexplained, exponential rise in our kWh usage of some 71% .We have put the following to British Gas: that for British Gas satisfaction the date for their own accuracy meter test this goes ahead with no charge to us. And the independent investigation, under OPSS conditions, goes ahead on a later date. Result silence. Also the above was copied in to the Energy Ombudsman. Result refusal by the case handler to accept the email detailing our request for an independent investigation and no supportive action. Total silence from the coach manager.",Yes,16-Jan-24,"Hello Richard, we're sorry to hear that you have not had a positive experience when using our services.

We were repeatedly told that Ovo were hard to communiate with and the Ombusman had no power to make them comply, finally being advised that if we had concerns we should take Ovo to court. Unexpectedly, debt collectors appeared at our door. Although we promptly settled the full balance, our request for the ombudsman to continue investigating went unanswered since September. Recently, a call from the ombudsman questioned why the case was still open, accompanied by rudeness and defensiveness, advising that the supplier had provided a bill and if we were still concerned we should raise another complaint - why the Ombusman couldn't of told us this in our year long communication is anyone's guess.

United Kingdom,11,1,02-Jun-23,6,2,2023,Totally useless & waste of time,"I have a complaint against E.ON Next (who supplied me with gas & electricity) concerning their fake & fraudulent billing. This matter has dragged on for about 12 months and still hasn't been resolved. I created a review of E,ON Next on Trustpilot today (2 June 2023) which you are welcome to read..As I was getting nowhere with E.ON Next, I raised a formal complaint with Energy Ombudsman in November 2022 citing the facts that E.ON Next started fake & fraudulent billing in May 2022 and showed no sign of resolving it.Over the following months I passed over to the Ombudsman a very considerable amount of documentary evidence showing the totally chaotic way.  I was being billed more than once a month with no rational explanation why. The Ombudsman finally came to a decision in May 2023. However the decision ignored much of the evidence I had provided them such as my so-called Smart Meter is totally useless and a major cause of the problem. It prevents me from properly viewing my energy usage and was sending out random readings to E.ON Next causing the chaotic billing. As I am on the E.ON Next Priority Service Register and unable to use the meter due to its very old age E.ON Next had refused to change it to a modern working one. I raised this with Ombudsman who similarly said words to the effect ""tough luck, you're not entitled to have one that works properly"".Ombudsman totally ignored the evidence I supplied on fraudulent billing and also refused to obtain recordings of some key telephone conversations I had with E.ON Next. Ombudsman also refused to accept an agreement I had reached with E.ON Next on the best date for monthly billing. Ombudsman didn't appear to be very interested in obtaining all the full and correct facts of the case, but just abruptly closed the case on 5 May 2023 suggesting a small amount of compensation which I considered inappropriate due to the mass of fake and fraudulent billing I was subjected to over 12 months. There was still fresh & relevant evidence coming in showing that some of the Ombudsman's conclusions are evidently untrue. I had requested a time extension to add the new evidence to the case, but Ombudsman flatly refused indicating they were not interested in the new evidence.I was unable to agree to Ombudsman decision as I considered it seriously flawed with a significant amount of relevant information missing. Therefore Ombudsman scrapped the case.On 21 May I raised a formal complaint to Ombudsman Service about their appalling service including their findings some of which contradicted the evidence I supplied.

Scottish Power had submitted the wrong data when they installed the meter and the database said our new meter was 'de-energised' ie not working. and only Scottish Power could correct the error. Meanwhile the error didn't stop SP invoicing us regularly!! SP offered an ex gratia payment of £75! I provided OFGEM actual invoices for the period from the company to which we wanted to switch, for our old house 10m away, from which we had downsized. OFGEM said £75 ex gratia was fair. Absolutely disgusting - SP got away with ignoring our protestations for seven months, OFGEM were useless. SP's so-called apology letter was along the lines of 'we apologise if you have experienced any shortfalls in our service'. We are disgusted by the whole episode and SP will have loved it - £75 penalty for a company in a group earning 13 billion euros a year!Ofgem's response is also a whitewash - I do not need an explanation of how they reached their decision, it was patently obvious.  They were not interested in protecting the consumer or penalising a supplier deliberately using the system to keep a customer 'on the hook' paying a high tariff and unable to transfer. Not a word of reprimand for Scottish Power, not a word.",Yes,07-Jun-23,"Hi Martin, we're sorry that you haven't had a positive experience when using our services.

United Kingdom,1,1,04-May-23,5,2,2023,Don't believe what they tell you.,"I took up a complaint with the Ombudsman after my energy supplier failed to install classic prepayment meters, that is to say, key/card meters, not smart meters. The Ombudsman found in my favour and said my energy supplier should install the meters and explained that due to industry shortages of classic meters, this could take some time. Long story short, six months later and after two attempts at installing smart meters, not only has my energy provider not installed the classic meters, they now claim that they are not receiving my emails and that there is nothing further they can do. Because of this the Ombudsman now consider my complaint resolved based on what my energy provider has told them and supposed evidence they have provided. If they had bothered to check with me, what they would find is that I have been responding to my energy providers emails and that it comes as a surprise to hear them say otherwise. However, there is no way for me to get this point across to the Ombudsman as far as I can tell. They are perfectly happy to take what my energy provider tells them at face value without hearing my side of the story. So basically my energy provider gets away with not doing what the Ombudsman told them they had to do. Which makes them pretty much pointless. Pointless being the stars I would award if Trustpilot would let me.",Yes,09-May-23,Hi John.

United Kingdom,6,1,31-Mar-23,3,1,2023,My complaint was with OVO,"My complaint was with OVO, an energy company. My gas and electricity were previously supplied by SSE. When OVO took over SSE my account was transferred over. On the transfer SSE incorrectly stated I owed them money. A week later SSE issued a corrected statement confirming SSE owed me >£250. This correction was communicated to both me and OVO.Despite this OVO continue to falsely accuse me of owing them money. OVO keep referring to the initial (and incorrect) statement and ignore the correct statement that confirms SSE (and by extension OVO) in fact owe me money. I explained all of the above to Steven, the Ombudsman customer rep, he reassured me that he understood my issue and would ask OVO to confirm how the calculated the bill but also ask them why they are choosing to ignore the corrected statement issued by SSE.OVO responded ignoring the corrected statement - instead they referred to the initial/incorrect/rescinded SSE statement as evidence.I have been offered £50, no correction, no admission that OVO owe me money, no explanation, and now the Ombudsman has decided the case is closed. It isn't. I will be calling again and asking for my case to be escalated and if necessary taken to court.It is not right that a customer should be financially inconvenienced and made to pay for transfer errors made when a energy company is bought out by another.

You have corrected, or maybe changed is better, my monthly usage estimate to £77 How many more mistakes will you make. I changed the direct debit to £150, being 1/12 of your estimate of £180 projected usage.I DID tell you they were constantly changing my direct debit and you, somehow decided that ""In regard to your billing, I am satisfied that Shell Energy did amend your direct debit to £58 which was sufficiently covering your usage as your account was in credit for a number of months. I can see that your account appeared as a debit balance due to estimated readings on your account, however once rebilled correctly this put your account back in credit. I can confirm that Shell Energy are expected to reassess your direct debit, however you also have the ability to keep on top of your direct debit so for example if you can see that you are using more energy and feel that your direct debit needs to be increased you can request this"".

I am mainly highlighting that The Ombudsman services are capable of proposing a resolution that is far from facts on what is right or wrong. PLEASE, read through any proposed resolutions thoroughly before accepting them.I have recently completed a 2-4 months complaint that has left me worst-off than when I took the complaint to them. My complaint with BT and its services was escalated to The Ombudsman Services because I requested to exit my contract on a missold basis, just a few weeks into a 2 years contract for broadband services.It was clear that BT was unable to deliver the promised speeds but the staff would not let go.  At the time of contacting The Ombudsman, BT had acknowledged they were unable to deliver promised broadband speeds, they had offered to cancel all charges but were reluctant to compensate for 6 months of administrative inconsistencies. Whilst with The Ombudsman, after submitting copies of all communications, the case handler mainly played the ""Devils Advocacy"". The gentleman capitalized on my ignorance and proposed a resolution with rather twisted wording with his decision. I failed to read through and only realized what he did after BT started contacting again for payment for the same services that they were unable to deliver. I contacted the case handler, and despite acknowledging what he had done, his comments were mainly aligned with the 14-day deadline for reviewing decisions that had passed and that nothing could be done about it.After reading a few reviews, I can hardly understand why the government is standing by and allowing The Ombudsman Services to continue to let down the same people they are meant to protect or serve.

United Kingdom,1,1,06-Jul-22,7,3,2022,I made two cases with this Ombudsman.,"I made two cases with this Ombudsman.      They are a disgrace to the country and clearly corrupt.That is clearly demonstrated in my second case against Eon.Next when Eon.Next had stopped me leaving them with the use of a Fraudulent estimate.I had a dual fuel account with Eon.Next and they issued a bill which declared I was around £253.00 in debt on my Gas and yet, I had already informed them that the house was empty and no Electricity or Gas was being used, but in the same bill, they said that I had used no Electricity.That is impossible, since the two are intrinsically linked.(Never mentioned in the Ombudsmans review).A few days prior to issuing this Fraudulent estimate they emailed to say they estimated I would use £107.47 for the coming year, so how could they estimate 253.58 for a months use, just a few days later.( Never mentioned in the Ombudsmans review)Further to that, in October, when I was Told by my Switched to company that the Gas part of the switch had not gone through, When queried, Eon.next emailed to say that they were sorry to report it, but my Gas was still with them.They said I should ask Blue Planet why? Apparently, Eon.Next didn't know why the switch didn't happen, but continued to bill me for Gas.Lies.(Never mentioned in the Ombudsmans review)They should have, according to Ofgems SLC, informed me that they had stopped my switch, but they never did.(Never Mentioned in the Ombudsmans review)The switch was supposed to happen on the 27 th of September 2021.Eon.Next are still demanding payment for bills they keep issuing despite knowing they used this Fraudulent estimate to stop my Switch.They also continue to stop me switching to the company I should legally be with, saying I cannot move when I have a debt to them, which of course, I do not( No mention in the Ombudsmans review). I told the Ombudsman I required them to put me with the company I had legally chosen to move to, that I would only pay the company I had chosen for the Gas and Standing charges used after the Switch date, and that I wanted compensation for the Fraud .In their ruling, the Ombudsman first said that the Eon.Next were entitled to send me an estimate under their terms and conditions, so they had no case to answer, but on appeal quoted another of Ofgems SLC that Eon.Next should have made every effort to use available information in their estimate.They did not use the information presented.    However, despite agreeing they did not follow the rules the Ombudsman ruled there should be no further action, because I had been awarded £200.00 already.The problems with that are that the £200.00 award was for a previous, and definitely separate case, which was already agreed, and nothing like as serious as this Fraudulent action.So, the Ombudsman got their information wrong. They have left me with Eon.Next, which is illegal, and a clear abuse of Ofgems SLC, when they should have taken action to ensure I would be moved to the company I had legally chosen.They ignored the obvious fraud perpetrated by Eon.Next and now Eon.Next are quoting this case number as a reason to try to charge me for monies I do not owe, and to pretend they are still my legal supplier of Gas.Its an appalling abuse of SLC and me as a Consumer.I have instructed Eon.Next that if they do not put me with the company I should be with, then I will have no option but to have my Gas supply cut off and change my method of heating my house and water because I will not pay anything to the criminal Eon.Next.The only course left to me now is to take Eon.Next to court.      I should never have been put in this situation by the Energy Ombudsman, but I refuse to allow Eon.Next to dictate to me, when they have no legal contract to do so.The Ombudsman needs to be Binned.So do Eon.Next, if you can get away from the Crooks.

United Kingdom,23,1,06-Apr-22,4,2,2022,Very un-satisfied,"I am extremely disappointed with the result from the Ombudsman. They did not take on board the true reason behind my complaint, nor the nature of my complaint, this was completely overlooked, neither was the negligence considered. All comments from the other party Eon were accepted, despite the proof and evidence I submitted.Don't think or expect a fair decision to be made. The settlement amount of £50 submitted by the Ombudsman to be paid is a pittance, and less than a third of the original amount offered by the other party. So don't think you will automatically have a fairer amount for your case submitted by the Ombudsman.We’re not taking about a lot of money here! It would seem they have set amounts for the nature of the complaint, which became obvious after discussing an appeal with the case worker. It would not change anything; I was in their box of ‘poor service’. I realised an appeal would only be another complete waste of time!Therefore, despite the company ignoring my un-resolved complaint, emails and letters for 2 years and using Covid as a convenience cover, they (the other party) did nothing. The original complaint was completely overlooked, and the other party did exactly what they wanted, including I learnt marking the complaint as resolved! Issuing Debt letters to an 84 year old, opening and closing accounts, taking Direct Debit monies all of this without one letter to my mother. I did not go into this to make some ‘fast bucks’ just a fair amount for stress, anxiety and more important my time!

United Kingdom,10,1,10-Mar-22,3,1,2022,"What a joke of a ""service""","What a joke of a ""service"". They literally lie. They cover up for EE. They ignore facts. I had actual written evidence and they still kept lying and gaslit me, just like EE did.Apparently it is perfectly fine for a company to lie, to ignore their customers, to refuse to send a final early termination fee and to instead keep sending monthly bills, and to brush under the carpet the fact that they sent an engineer who verbally assaulted me and made me fear for my safety and health!What excellent work.We pay them money, and they get away with whatever they like.They've been fined £100k for a data breach which saw them send unsolicited advertisements to a load of customers. Amoral. They don't protect the consumer at all, they patronise and then side with the company.Here is an excerpt from the Wikipedia page, regarding just some of the controversies that EE have been involved in:""In August 2014, EE started a new service where customers could queue-jump when phoning EE customer services for a one off cost of 50p to be fast tracked out of the queue to an available agent. This sparked outrage among consumers who viewed the option as at extortionate charge for being put through promptly to a member of staff; something which should be standard.[114]Later that month, EE was accused of trying to silence complaining customers on social media networks, such as Facebook and Twitter. Customers claimed that the company deleted their complaints on the company's Facebook page. The company discourages customers from posting their grievances in public, preferring private messages.[115]In May 2015, EE became the most complained-about phone and broadband provider, according to regulator, Ofcom. Complaints against the UK's largest mobile operator related to topics ranging from line faults, service and provision issues to bill problems.[116]""And yet the Ombudsman response and appeal response, both read like they are on EE payroll. I have had broadband faults, refusal to deal with my issues in written form (I'm autistic and have mental health issues, meaning that phone calls cause severe anxiety), customer service that is appalling AND they took money from my account without my knowledge or agreement, and didn't sell me the final bill they promised and instead locked me out of my account so that I couldn't even view it on line. Then, magically  I was suddenly able to access it, after I complained. They refused to admit that they had anything to do with it! What is the point of an Ombudsman service that ignore facts?Reporting EE was a complete waste of my time and ended with me having an anxiety attack when I read their response. The anxiety trigger ongoing health conditions, so that was just wonderful.And EE still haven't sent me a final bill. Now I'm terrified of debt collection letters for money that I don't owe.Abysmal service.Oh,and they also got the service provider  wrong in their response, calling them BT...and refused to even comment on the fact that EE won't send a final bill and instead keep sending me monthly Bill's because ""this was not included in the initial complaint"" even though they have written proof that I asked for an early termination final bill more than once, which, almost two months on, still hadn't materialised. If this affects my credit score I will be fuming angry. I have done nothing wrong and yet I'm the one who has to pay; mentally, physically and monetarily. I am so disgusted. I think I'm even more disgusted with the Ombudsman than I am with EE!! Oh, and the feedback survey link they sent is broken. Surprise, surprise.

United Kingdom,2,1,27-Jan-22,1,1,2022,An appendage of the energy companies.,"To call them toothless would be a compliment, they are not even independent. They may be able to help where the energy company is just useless and that probably accounts for the positive reviews. But if it is something serious they quickly wash their hands of it. They are not in the business of properly holding the energy companies to account when it really matters. In my case the energy company basically objected to the complaint and then it was closed before it was investigated!  I'm rather glad it was dropped at that stage instead of being dragged through a sham process that was doomed to fail.  My documentary evidence is so strong however that it would be impossible not to find in my favour.  Whatever excuse is used to justify closing it by the ombudsman, I believe it is because the energy company couldn't bear an investigation and the ombudsman supported that.You may be better off skipping this and pursuing other channels such as social media, national media, legal or even political if we are not going to end up in a fully blown basket case dictatorship where corruption is the rule and random officials can stop your car and demand money off you.REPLY to Ombudsman:I didn't have account with the energy company, that was the reason they gave it was an invalid query. However they had attached a debt to my name. Without an account number I was unable to access their internal complaints procedure. This was all originally understood and considered valid by you so I'm not sure it's a rule. This particular matter has fortunately now been resolved through a debt agent. It's just lucky I even found out about the debt when I did as they didn't even have any contact information for me. The debt belongs to someone else by the way.  The rule is apparently  that you do as you are told by the energy companies.",Yes,01-Feb-22,"Hi Fiona, We are sorry to hear that you feel that way.

Went to Ombudsman with my case and provided evidence I had of Scottish Power lying to me, through several Webchats, as well as documents confirming I was still within the cool off period. This took months and months and the money I was giving to Scottish Power went up and up. The Ombudsman did find in my ""favour"" and their ruling was for SP to release me and pay me £100. I had already been with SP for a number of months, trying to resolve it myself, before going to the Ombudsman, so £100 was a drop in the ocean to what I'd already paid them.

United Kingdom,42,1,15-Sep-21,9,3,2021,Complete waste of time,"I have nothing constructive to include in my review, i have given my experience and a true account of what happened, and my opinions.The energy ombudsman totally failed me, by failing to investigate the number one issue in my complaint, that my home monitor unit for my energy meter was not working and hadn't been since May 2021, once I informed the ombudsman that they had failed to include this in their investigation I received an email advising me to let sse know it wasn't working, the whole reason i had contacted the ombudsman in the first place was because sse were failing to address and resolve the fact my home monitoring unit was not working, so was extremely confused and infuriated that the ombudsman response was to tell me what I had been telling sse for weeks and weeks, This is now still unresolved partly due to the fact the ombudsman failed to include the main issue of the complaint, in fact they admitted they had forgotten to add this via a telephone conversation I had with the investigating officer.It is impossible to get in touch with the ombudsman if you need to discuss issues with the reports findings, emails totally ignored, one was answered and that was it, i was left for a whole day trying to get through via telephone, left voice messages, totally ignored, until I actually got lucky and my call was finally answered.Was pretty much pressured to accept findings in order to move forward and let sse try and address the issues, which so far they have not.My mental health condition was totally over looked and not taken into consideration when dealing with the stress caused by the on going complaint with sse.Online ombudsman services are inadequate they hardly work, when trying to fill in a complaint form regards to the inadequate service I received, the form kept crashing and wouldn't go through.When email customer service about technical issues etc none were answered.I would not recommend the energy ombudsman simply because they are , in my opinion incompetent at dealing with the simplist task of investigating a complaint thoroughly.They gave, in my opinion the impression they just wanted to wash their hands of the problems filed in my complaint once they completed their so called investigation.Utter and complete waste of time using the energy ombudsman,  they simply aren't that interested in holding energy companies accountable for their failings, I am no further forward with my issues with sse at the current time.",Yes,20-Sep-21,"Hi Mel, We are sorry that you haven't had a positive experience when using our services.

United Kingdom,9,1,28-May-21,5,2,2021,John Lewis put on fault. Took over 300 days to repair. Ombudsman supports JL,"John Lewis introduced a fault onto my service when they upgraded my broadband speed. Obviously the first place to look for the fault would be in the newly introduced exchange equipment. John Lewis refused to do this, despite repeated requests. They then closed my query unresolved. After more than 300 days they informed me that they had indeed found a faulty card in the exchange and had carried out the repair. They then FORGOT to actually carry out the repair! The ombudsman agent found that John Lewis had no case to answer!It appears to me that the ombudsman is too close to the companies it is supposed to be policing.My advice is that we should pass the details of our cases to our MP's, who will pass on the details to the correct Ministerial Department. We should also pass these details on to the BBC's Rip of Britain, who, incidentally, are currently interested in the effectiveness of our ombudsmen.I have two questions for the ombudsman:1) What percentage of complainants cases do you uphold? Bearing in mind that by the time you become involved they will already have expended a great deal of time and energy as they will have great confidence in their case. I would expect you would find in the complainants favour well over 90% of the time.What is the actual percentage?2) It's my belief that John Lewis wouldn't investigate the exchange fault because it would make them liable to a charge by Openreach. Would it?As you will have gathered, it seems to me the ombudsman has as many problems as John Lewis. Perhaps we need an ombudsman for the ombudsman.And still the ombudsman avoids the question: In what percentage of cases does the ombudsman find in the complainants favour? John Lewis put a fault ON during an upgrade, took over 300 days to FIND the (obvious) fault and then FORGOT to rectify it and still comes up trumps with the ombudsman we know we are likely to be wasting our time.",Yes,02-Jun-21,"Hi John, We are sorry to hear that you didn't get the outcome you had hoped for through raising your complaint with us.

I have an exhaustive list of calls and times which have not been updated on the system .... conveniently. ow the Ombudsman allow a compnay to carry out so many major non compliances and basic information and GDPR data without penalty.

It speaks volumes when a telecoms service provider can completely ignore a complaint via the Ombudsman service, and can't even be bothered to put forward any evidence in a case whatsoever - it's almost as if they knew that they didn't need to bother themselves with it.Needless to say, I will not be renewing any services with Elite Group in the future and will be making this complaint known in any customer reviews via their web site.If ever asked by a friend, or colleague, if they should escalate an issue or complaint to the Ombudsman Service, I will unfortunately have to advise them not to waste their time!Yours sincerelyDavid",Yes,21-Oct-20,"Hello David, judging by your review it appears you haven't brought a complaint to us and used our service?

You also have a situation where you can either accept or reject their outcome, if you accept it that’s fine. But if as in my case part of the determination was wrong, if you reject it, any financial reward offered is immediately withdrawn. The Ombudsman is clearly toothless as they instructed Scottish Power three times to stop chasing payment whilst my complaint was ongoing and Scottish Power completely ignored them.An Ombudsman service funded by the energy industry can never be truly independent.",Yes,21-Oct-20,"Hello, thank you for your review.

The mobile phone company in question stole nearly £1000 from 2 separate bank accounts, even when I had no contracts with them at all, and this was deemed acceptable by the ombudsman. I feel I was not given a fair try and even when I escalated the case, the same person looked at it. This is obviously not going to produce a different resolution so it makes no sense.

Scottish Power (SP) have been bullying myself and my partner for the past 12 months, trying to get us to pay an energy bill that isn't ours (Someone else's meter on the bill). Although the Ombudsman did side with us, SP have completely ignored the requirements set out by the Ombudsman and put a credit default against our names.  They've now handed the debt over to a debt collection agency for the 2nd time. This in turn has had a detrimental effect on us applying for a mortgage and trying to buy a house. Anyway, SP said they had done everything that had been asked of them (Of the 6 action points required of them it looks like may have done 1 of them, maybe) and the Ombudsman took their word for it and closed the case (Honestly, it's incredible injustices like this actually go on in the world). The energy Ombudsman people are nice enough but their organisation is in the pockets of the energy providers and as such, what they say and what they do is completely disregarded. Do yourself a favour, just pay the bills (Obviously not if there's £000s involved) as th energy companies literally have to answer only to themselves . . . . If I could go back and pay the incorrect bill, I would. We're now about 50 hours in, a lot of stress, a bad credit score, probably unable to get a mortgage and the Ombudsman offered us £150 as a gesture of goodwill (Incredible really . . . )",Yes,24-Aug-20,"Hello, we're sorry you have had a bad experience.

Her property clearly has no cold calling signs by the doorbell. The Shell representative entered my mums house, went through her private and personal financial records and proceeded to sell her a more expensive Electricity tariff. I identified all of the above to the Energy Ombudsman and Mr Millar of the organisation confirmed that the Shell Tariff was more expensive  but failed to decide in my mums favour. I raised the issue to two senior members of staff, neither responded until I persistently chased.My view is, and by the comments I have read, I  wonder what the purpose of this organisation is. A blatant case of a large corporate company illegally entering the property of an 89 year old , vulnerable lady ,living alone and suffering from dementia, and selling her a more expensive Energy tariff than she was on, and then siding with the corporate company.

United Kingdom,16,1,08-Nov-19,11,4,2019,Waste of time,"The jobsworth complaints officer simply regurgitated the deliberately, deceptively obtuse statements of IDMobile back to me; that the provider does not have to 100% provide coverage, 100% of the time.This is an argument that I did not make.  I argued that the coverage in the area of central London where I work was adequate during the 30 day break period and was subsequently affected by a FIVE month, ongoing, network outage that IDMobile has admitted was due to a fault and an engineer actually admitted to me that they have too many subscribers on their bandwidth.I argued that, if I had experienced the absolute joke of coverage during the 30 day break period, I would not have continued the contract.  This is a completely reasonable argument.They actually stated that they are satisfied with IDMobile's position because they've escalated the issue.In what world is a FIVE month outage acceptable?It's fairly clear that Ombudsmen Services simply exists to provide a thin veneer of respectability & fairness with zero intention of taking on their corporate masters who fund them.Do not use Ombudsmen Services.  Do not give them the justification of their existence.  Put the jobsworths out of a job.And do not use IDMobile.UPDATE: To address the comment, below:52% is an attractive but meaningless statistic without knowing the facts of the cases involved.  Maybe 52% of cases are impossible to rule otherwise.  What I do know is that in 100% of the cases involving my mobile coverage and the 5 month network outage affecting it, Ombudsman Services regurgitated a rebuttal to the ridiculous strawman argument that I am expecting 100% coverage in 100% of locations and ruled against that argument instead of the argument I actually made.",Yes,13-Nov-19,"Hi Andy,Sorry to hear that you're unhappy with our decision in your case.We strive to make decisions that are fair, looking at the facts and evidence  supplied by both parties in a dispute.Regarding your comment about our member companies being our ""corporate masters"",  it's worth highlighting that  in 2018 we upheld 52%  of communications complaints - meaning we found in favour of the consumer in the majority of cases.

United Kingdom,34,1,24-May-19,5,2,2019,Looks like they are too friendly with the companies they arbitrate.,"I had to go to this service because Plusnet persisted to demand charges after the end of my contract with them. They even recruited a debt recovery agency to persue me for the £50 they reckoned I owed them. Plusnet eventually said they had made a mistake but I continued to get hassle from them. So I went to their ombudsman service.I had answered 25 emails and text from Plusnet, I had a debt recovery agency chasing me. This ombudsman service made an award of £25 in my favour. I felt insulted. I had been placed under so much stress by Plusnet demanding money which they were not entitled to. Plusnet attempted to inflate their incorrect charges by adding admin and debt recovery charges. As someone who has never had a bad debt in my life, It was 4 months of hell.I tried to challenge the ombudsman, arguing that the award was far to small for the events leading to the complaint. They took 2 weeks to look at an appeal. Result, the very same person decided the award was correct. Whats the point in the same person looking at an appeal. Pathetic.I now feel that this company have a very cosy agreement with the services that they arbitrate. They take their fat fee (not disclosed!), give the complainant a few bob and allow companies like Plusnet to keep abusing customers and getting away with it very lightly.Dont forget, all ombudsman  are responsible to parliament for conducting fair arbitration.

United Kingdom,6,5,31-Jul-24,7,3,2024,"Speed, diligence and attentive customer care","Incredibly grateful for the Energy Ombudsman investigating a series of back billing / reverse charges added to my account by Good Energy, which added up to around £4000 folloowing a fault on a meter that caused it not to record usage for a short period of time. After a year of dealing with the Good Energy customer service team, every time a resolution seemed close paperwork was lost or auhtorisation was needed from someone else.  When my case needed re starting for a thrid time I contacted the Energy Ombudsman. On the same day I received a phone call from my named case handler, Umar, who was courteous, patient and ressured me by describing the process going forward.  Just as he described, I and the energy company were given a fixed time to present our evidence followed by a fixed time for the ombudsman to investigate. The Energy Company made an immeadiate offer to write off a small portion of the supposed debt, which I refused as their letter still made no explanation of what the charges were for, as I have always paid my bills. Following Umar's investigation of the over 50 documents including bills and email exchages with Good Energy, it came to light that Good Energy were assuming my meter had historically been faulty due to low usage and were trying to bill 3 years of estimated additional usage.  Thankfully Umar checked against my current usage on the new smart meter and assessed that not only were the back charges unreasonable but that actually I had been over charged by around 55% in the first place, possibly due to the faulty meter.  Alongside a rectified bill, the ombudsman indicated that Good Energy should issue a Goodwill payment and apology - all of which they did immeadiately. Not only was this reso;ution explained clearly in wirting, but Umar also rang to ensure it was alll clear and there were no remaining issues.I am impressed with the speed and thoroughness of the Energy Ombudsman's work and the attentive customer care.

United Kingdom,4,5,24-Nov-23,11,4,2023,The Energy Ombudsman and Electricity suppliers,"The Ombudsman instructed a major UK  based Electricity/Generator supplier to refund an £78 overpayment on an Estimated final bill, which took from payment to refund over 11 months. It took the Ombudsman approximately 2 months to resolve BUT possibly due to the Electricity Supplies own internal mechanisms, or maybe intentional FURTHER delays.The numerous verbal and email statements and agreements from the supplies own Customer Service staff never materialised, I was getting absolutely nowhere with them. These large companies maybe believe they are too powerful, possibly expecting most people to give up, HOWEVER!!!!!!! there is an Energy Ombudsman.I first approached Citizens Advice who immediately stated I should contact the Energy Ombudsman once they realise the length of time this matter had been going on forThe process was so easy with the Ombudsman, I explained the issues and  was then past onto a case handler,  notes taken by them, I downloaded emails and telephone records onto their website and it was basically left with them. On seeing all the information, the Ombudsman’s representative agreed to take on the case. It helped that very detailed records of ALL verbal and email communications were made throughout the process of dealing with the Electricity company, a bit of a bind and very time consuming but really worth it in the end, start early with these records.The Ombudsman also penalised the Electricity company for various breaches of standards, unfortunately although this was good for me, it will not be not enough to make the supplier stand up and take note to review its poor practices. This payment was extremely “small fish” when you are aware of the profits these companies have been making over the last few years, will they be concerned, doubtful.Anyhow, a small win for me and a nice Xmas present. ALL for the sake of somebody (or many people) at the Electricity company not doing their JOBS, it could have been resolved with one phone call and just the refund of the overpayment, but alas, some bright spark in the system probably thought they would make a name for themselves, the penalties should be taken from their salaries.All that said, the Ombudsman is there to help us, so please use them, they are VERY effective BUT obviously you must have detailed, truthful and accurate records to provide.",Yes,29-Nov-23,"Hi Mark, thank you for taking the time to share your experience of using our services.

United Kingdom,1,5,07-Jun-23,6,2,2023,Huge thanks,"I would recommend the Ombudsman Services to anyone who believes they have been mistreated by organisations – large and/or small. I had a claim for a very small amount, not mega bucks, against a mobile phone company and wanted a refund of my unused credit after the closure of PAYG service. Online, the company displayed a notice declaring that they would refund any credit by cheque – but other notices contradicted this and some even said there would be a charge (which wiped out your balance) when you moved elsewhere under some PAC process.The Ombudsman accepted my case and achieved a result in six weeks or so when I had achieved nothing in 18 months of trying. It was a year-and-a-half of unrelated and irrelevant template replies from the company’s non-functioning complaints set up and their online chat that filibustered its way round in circles before chucking me out! The Ombudsman Service is friendly and helpful. And it’s free. The process is fair and you will need to be patient as everybody gets a chance to respond and have their say and the inevitable “cheque in the post routine”.",Yes,12-Jun-23,"Hi Ian, that's great to hear!

United Kingdom,6,5,18-Nov-22,11,4,2022,Thumbs up.,"I didn't hold out much hope because of negative reviews but I've just used this service and got a great result. I had kept evidence and had a diary of dates of issues arising. I also did research into my rights before using the service. If you have great hard evidence, screenshots, emails, letters etc you must hand this all over to the ombudsman. If they don't have evidence it is very hard for them to help you. The balance has to be tipped massively in your favour or the benefit of the doubt will be given to the company you are complaining about. Keep a diary of events and write a clear and concise complaint is my advice. Sorry to be blunt but if you're just whining about things not being fair or morally right and got no evidence then you stand much less chance of winning your case.

United Kingdom,8,5,07-Sep-22,9,3,2022,Red Letter from EDF,My original energy company was Green Network Energy who's accounting was erratic and unreliable - one day I was hundreds in credit and next day it was reversed - in the end they ceased trading!EDF was contracted to recover all debt owed to GNE and almost 2 years later they sent me a big red letter demanding full payment within 7 days or they would refer it to a debt collection agency.  I emailed them and advised that far from me owing GNE they owed me and I sent them a full statement of account I had received from GNE before they went bust.We then entered into an email discussion with EDF producing figures which they themselves could not explain.  For my part it was simple arithmetic - add up all that I had paid to GNE and then see if that was greater or smaller than the cost of the energy I had used - this proved that GNE owed me but EDF would not listen or explain how they calculated that I owed them using the same figures.Eventually it became clear that EDF did not want to listen and I took the matter to the Ombudsman and submitted all the evidence ie emails from GNE and EDF and a copy of GNE's accounting.  Basically EDF did not challenge the Ombudsman's finding in my favour which means that they had no evidence to prove that I owed anything and they never had.If it hadn't been for the Ombudsman I have no doubt that EDF would have referred it to debt collectors - thank heavens for the Ombudsman!,Yes,12-Sep-22,"Hi Red, We understand your dispute with EDF must have been concerning and we are glad that we were able to help you reach a resolution to the complaint.

One of our supplies had a Smart Meter fitted in 2015 by Ovo and has worked satisfactorily ever since. Last Spring (2021) we requested Ovo to fit a Smart Meter to the other supply so we could fit PV Solar Panels and a Tesla Battery. The two meters are side by side but Ovo refused to fit a Smart Meter to the second supply stating we had no WAN coverage. This despite the fact the first meter had operated successfully since 2015 using the WAN system. The impasse continued for at least 9 months until I contacted the Ombudsman when their case officer, Beryl, reviewd all the evidence I had sent her and persuaded Ovo to fit a Smart Meter. They duly did so but it was not fit for purpose because it was not compatible with Tesla Batteries. They agreed to change the Meter for a suitable one but failed to turn up on the appointed day to do this. Back to Beryl, who could not have been more helpful and is currently sorting out this latest hiccup for us. Roger W Reed.

Having done this I could not understand Bulb wanting further payments to clear off my account- Bulb chased me for monies owed- Bulb ""reversionised"" my bills going back to 2017 when the disputed period was only August 2020 to March 2021- Removed my monthly statements from the system, so I could not investigate Bulb's claims of monies owed- My account since 2017 had always had a credit balance- With Bulb removing my statements I could no longer check credits and debits from my bank statement to my Bulb account- Bulb refused to deal with my dispute in a sensible & timely manner, would not engage in communication or even answer my emails, clearly laying out my issues, comments & questions- I had got to the point where I instructed my solicitors to go to courtBulb after I believe not being able to settle my issue gave me an opportunity to take this up with the Ombudsman & whilst I did not hold out much hope, it was at least another avenue to explore & somewhat cheaper than going to courtI clearly laid out my issues to the case officer these included:- going back to 2017- annotating credit & debits I believe were issues & inappropriately placed on my account- raised the issues with Bulb's customer service, the handling of my case & poor customer service received- Disputed the final sum owed- Highlighted in excess of 30 credits  & debits I was unhappy withLet me say I was surprised after 20 days I got a full answer on all of my items raised.- Each credit & debit was carefully explained- The running balance was updated also with my credit payments- Clear summaries of Bulb refunding my credit amounts- The area of concern between August 2020 to March 2021 being dealt with simply & concisely- Recommendations to both parties namely Bulb to issue a letter of apology for the handling of the case, compensation to be awarded for the frustration caused to me along with the shortfall in customer service & for me to then pay the remaining payment caused by the mis reading of the smart meter, but equally I had used the energy as I had supplied the relevant Monthly readingsThis to me was a great outcome & I was somewhat amazed at how much work the Ombudsman had put in to answer all of my questions & come to a suitable conclusion for all parties.For me I would recommend the Ombudsman & was impressed with their diligence, professionalism & handling of my case",Yes,18-Jan-22,"Hi There, Thank you so much for leaving us such a detailed review.

United Kingdom,1,5,13-Oct-21,10,4,2021,Settled a 18 month dispute- thank you,"An incorrect billing dispute with my previous energy company was getting no where after 18 months, so I finally decided to take it to the ombudsman and immediately felt supported and communicated clearly and professionally by them. This was a huge relief as I cannot describe how stressed out the complaints process with a big energy company made me feel. I made sure to provide as much evidence as I had (a lot, as the issue had rumbled on for so long) and also used the messaging service to update the ombudsman when the energy company continued to contact me despite the dispute being escalated. I think I had realistic ideas about any potential compensation I would receive, but the ombudsman also ensured that the energy company billed me correctly on the appropriate tariff- something that really made a difference and I had felt unable to even request myself, as the energy company had spun me round in so many circles I couldn’t see straight anymore.The ombudsman did absolutely what their service sets out to do, and independently reviewed and made a decision to settle my dispute with this energy provider, and I could not ask for more than that. I would encourage anyone who is feeling powerless and at their wits end to go through just one more process and use the service that is there to ensure these companies are doing what they should, and that you are not being disadvantaged. Especially within the energy sector, I believe that this will continue to be an essential service to support vulnerable people in the coming months and years.

United Kingdom,2,5,28-May-21,5,2,2021,Communications Ombudsman Fails to Heed Evidence,"This was a most disappointing experience. I presented a situation where, without my request or authorisation, data bundles on an automatic repeat were added to my account by EE. I will declare that the EE customer service was excellent, the Company admitted that there was no evidence of a request being made and could not explain why the data bundles had been added but they stated they were only able to authorise part repayment and I found this  to be unacceptable. I sought the support of the Ombudsman Communications; regrettably, their investigation seemed to focus entirely on whether a complaints process had been followed by EE (not the cause of my complaint) and the investigators simply ignored the lack of evidence provided by the Company and ignored the fact that there was written evidence from the Company that confirmed that no evidence could be presented to support any request being made. By refusing to support my complaint Ombudsman Communications has demonstrated tacit support for what is clearly industry malpractice. I would not now recommend this service to anyone as there is a complete absence of fairness with EE gradually siphoning over £600 without any authority and still not asked to make any form of repayment - scandalous",Yes,02-Jun-21,"Hello, We are sorry that you feel that way. Our role isn't to be in favour of either party, our role is to investigate the issues within the complaint from both perspectives and establish a fair resolution. Our team consider multiple factors when conducting their investigation, including identifying if the levels of customer service given by the provider during the complaint were acceptable and whether the provider took the necessary steps to try to resolve the complaint using their own complaints handling procedure before the complaint reached us.  We are sorry that you didn't have the best experience when using our services on this occasion but appreciate you leaving us your review.",5

It takes time, but for little issues it is a very razonable time and, if you have the evidences I don't doubt about that the decision will be on your side. My problem was with OVO Energy that decided a reading in electricity and gas and charged me about 300 pounds for 6 days as I was switching providers.After 6 months waiting for them to solve the problem, I went to the ombudsman and, it took 2 months, but it is now solved without any more discussions with the OVO customer services plus a compensation. The people from the Ombudsman who worked the case (Tom Keenan and Kevin Quinn) were very efficient and responded very fast to my messages.",Yes,04-May-21,"Hi Noemi, We are happy we were able to help you get a resolution with OVO and thank you for your lovely feedback about our team, I will make sure I pass this over to them!

United Kingdom,6,5,29-Apr-21,4,2,2021,New build home issues,"Recently bought a new build home. British gas supplied the electricity. Unfortunately, they had a neighbouring properties meter connected to my account. When this was rectified 2 months later they put me on the standard tariff contrary to what I signed up with and refused to sort out the smart meter or offer compensation. Went to the ombudsman, This led to British gas backdating the tariff and offering compensation without needing an ombudsman investigation. They failed to implement all the agreed resolution. I escalated this using the ombudsman escalation process. Although the process took longer than set out, the ombudsman found in my favour and agreed that British gas should implement the resolution they agreed to as well as sending an engineer out to sort out the smart meter issues. Apart from the slight delay, I was thoroughly happy with the process which I did completely online, and the Ombudsman who took time to understand and investigate the issue fairly and impartially.",Yes,04-May-21,"Hi Arron, Its great to hear that you now have the correct meter linked to your property and that the account has been set up correctly.

The Ombudsman broke the communication block, made the supplier hand the account back to my new supplier, pay me compensation for bad customer service, issue a letter of apology and decided I should only pay a fair ate for the electric consumed.

The Ombudsman has helpful staff who keep you informed and this make a great service.Gathering your evidence takes time but you can start your case and add the necessary evidence later.This is easy if you are technically savvy, to put emails and photographs into the correct format but daunting if not.The shocking part is seeing the reply to your case from the energy company, who often manage to twist the truth, which makes it clear why you need an outside party to sort things out.

United Kingdom,8,1,13-Mar-24,3,1,2024,Just go legal directly,"To be honest - it felt like the energy companies can do whatever they want - like in my case for example, they said: we are going to check and recalculate. Ombudsman automatically changed the status to implemented before it actually happened. Than, the energy company said “we are not changing anything” without presenting a single document besides what we all could see online - and I heard basically “there’s nothing we can do if they say they are not going to change” - even if they are the same saying you should be paying the half, when they are charging the double all along. Otherwise, the advisor was always contacting me at the end of the day on Friday, and not actually answering the phone. And when I said the decision was going to the wrong direction, what I said got rejected. At the end you have to go on the legal direction and spend more money. It feels like what I read online at social media - “Ombudsman is like the government, they are always siding companies, not people, so do not bother yourself for so long with them, cause at the end they are not going to do anything”. And nothing will actually replace the time you spent with all of this circus they call “help”.Ps. For the person who replied below - if paying £400 for a bill in a t2 when they said you should be paying £124 is correct, well - good luck to everybody trying to open a complain with them - what a joke.",Yes,19-Mar-24,"Hi Bia, we're sorry that you haven't had a positive experience when using our services.

Have an ongoing issues with OVO energy that are still unresolved but not according to the ombudsman they failed to address many of my concerns with ovo if they did they haven’t said they have. Failed to address a major problem with taking over my account without letting me know before they did and giving me the option to go elsewhere for a better deal. Failed to deal with every time you talk to them the first thing said is you owe us money we’re going to put a note on your credit file. The list goes on and on. The ombudsman is defiantly in the employ off the energy companies. In my opinion steer clear of the ombudsman and OVO energy,Yes,12-Dec-22,"Hello, We are sorry that you have not had a positive experience when using our services.

I submitted substantial evidence including calculations based on my Mum's annual usage and current contract rates. Individuals at OVO had agreed on 3 separate occasions that the amount should be £46 and OVO were automatically demanding around £120 per month. I suggested that the ombudsman request recordings of telephone conversations.  But I was told that despite the evidence gathering period being 2 weeks, OVO would have 6 weeks to submit any requested phone call recordings meaning that they wouldn't be available to use as evidence. The eventual ombudsman findings were based on what OVO said not on what OVO did. It misrepresented or ignored the facts. I challenged their decision but the challenge was also rejected with a load of nonsense including an assumption that My Mum would now be in debit when she was in fact over £200 in credit.

United Kingdom,3,1,17-Mar-22,3,1,2022,I'd have given them Zero if that was on…,"I'd have given them Zero if that was on offer.Let’s take this is 4 stages:1. Initial complaint; Fairly easy to create a complaint. However, at no point was it explained that photos, documents, attestations, times and dates or telephone calls should be uploaded. As a result, the complaint was added to with more and more evidence, a sort of drip feed, because it was never made clear that the utilities will try anything to avoid a penalty. I found the experience very poor and highly uninformative. 2. The investigation and decision: Despite the clear evidence provided by myself and the very poor evidence provided by the utility company a decision was made. This was after the Ombudsman informing me that the utility had not furnished additional requested documents. I noted that the evidence of the utility company was a word-of-mouth explanation. It had: zero supporting documents, zero transcripts, zero reports, zero usage logs, zero photos, zero logical explanation. The utility had an explanation so ludicrous it borders on incompetent that the Ombudsman believed it. I however, supplied photos, an explanation, and emails back and forth. The conclusion is that my evidence was not of a higher weight. No explanation was given that made sense of the decision. I found the Ombudsman to be weak and incompetent.3. The appeal: Having written an essay in response, the appeal was upheld. This is because further evidence was given: more photos, clear faults in the utilities case, questions that needed answering and a logic explanation as to why the utility company behaved as it did. Sadly, I did the job of the initial Ombudsman, therefore i found this to be an unnecessary stage, given it should have been done before. 4. The closure: My case has been closed, but I have not received ANY of the remediations: payment 1, payment 2 or a letter of apology. How is this even possible? In conclusion: The Ombudsman:does not consider the public to have the same weight as the utilities.does not investigate and question any explanations or evidence.does not ask for any additional evidence, or if it does, accepts that none sending of the evidence to be acceptable. accepts explanations from the utility company that are fanciful in the extreme and not credible.does not explain itself to the public and is, therefore, a closed decision-making body.is not independent, and is therefore in the pocket of the utilities.is toothless and beholden to the utilities as it will not request further explanations.In summary, because of the farcical way that the Ombudsman goes about its business, I would like to call the Ombudsman to the Ombudsman.",Yes,23-Mar-22,"Hi Brent, We are sorry that you are unhappy with your experience when using our services.

United Kingdom,31,1,01-Mar-22,3,1,2022,Waste of time,"Waste of time. They found in our favour on all three counts against Bulb - it would have been hard not to. The energy provider finally started to take action on the last possible day they were given and has still not properly resolved the situation after more than a year since we first complained. The Ombudsman did nothing to follow up once they had decided in our favour.The service is not independent. It is funded by the energy companies and the service wants to be as kind as possible to them. And then when the energy provider fails to take action, the Ombudsman says that they can't enforce their decision.  The service is merely there to make it look like customers have someone independent to complain to. The providers know there is nothing the Ombudsman can do so doesn't care.

There was poor continuity and the Ombudsman got rid of us as soon as possible.The response below from the Ombudsman mentions the ""remedy implementation team.""

United Kingdom,2,1,22-Feb-22,2,1,2022,What don't you understand.,"This is the second attempt to write a report....may I suggest you ask for the case reference at the beginning as I have now lost my report while looking for my reference....so here we go again !!! I am very disappointed with the Obudsman, there have been NO communication from them, until I was informed that my case has been resolved....My request was to be given smart meters.... I STILL HAVE NO SMART METERS... this has been going on for over a year. I have been informed by Eon Next that there is no signal where I live....however I was with Bulb who gave me a meter  that worked perfectly fine, when I changed to Eon, they sent out a so called engineer who said he couldn't get a signal and subsequently took my Bulb smart meter away....how comes Bulb gets a signal but Eon doesn't after that I was handed over to a company named Eon Next without any consultation, I didn't find out until I phoned to find out about my smart meter....I was told that I was no longer with Eon but now had a different account with Eon Next !!! Eon Next have rewarded me with money into my account  but that was not my problem..I WANT SMART METERS, what didn't you understand. Perhaps the Ombudsman should look into the company in this area who are supposed to install these meters as it appears Eon Next have their hands tied. I have been told that there is no signal here, however both the flat upstairs and the flat next door do get signals as they have smart meters..I was given to understand the Government have told us that anybody who wants can have these METERS, except presumably me !!As for closing my case, it's a farse..what's the point of having a case if nobody contacts the person who took it out, and just closes the case without consultation.",Yes,28-Feb-22,"Hi Pat, We are sorry to hear that you haven't had a positive experience when using our services. For Smart meters to function correctly, they require a wireless signal strong enough to connect to the meter to a communications infrastructure run through the Data communications company (DCC), This allows suppliers to access the meter remotely and obtain meter readings etc.. Unfortunately, there are areas where the signal is not strong enough for this function to perform correctly and the meter is unable to connect correctly. Whilst we understand that this can be frustrating, its not necessarily something the suppliers can currently control however,  all gas and electricity suppliers will have binding annual installation targets to roll out smart and advanced meters to their remaining non-smart customers by the end of 2025. I have passed your review over to the team who have dealt with your case so that they can establish if any further actions are required. Thank you for taking the time to leave us your review.",6

Eon had the incorrect meter info - no idea how. Eon sent me a bill for £850 for a year which is most definitely incorrect. After getting nowhere with Eon I contacted the ombudsman. It took too long for the ombudsman to review my case. After they did they ruled in my favour and instructed Eon to apologise for the inconvenience, produce an accurate bill taking into account the back billing rules and awarded me a small financial award. Although both myself and Eon accepted the ombudsmans ruling Eon have failed to act on it. If anything it went from bad to worse.No apology, back billed months they legally can not, failed to take into account the credit on my account and reissued a bill for £35,250.I contacted the ombudsman multiple times uploading evidence of the new bills from Eon. All I got was a standard response of their decision stands. I have tried to contact Eon again myself but with no success.I received yet another bill from Eon, again estimated despite regular meter readings, no mention of the credit on my account or the award from the ombudsman and still back dated the bill to more than 12 months ago. I asked the ombudsman to enforce their ruling as per the implementation policy. The ombudsman not only failed to do this, they went as far as saying the case has been resolved and closed the case.I can reopen the case in 14 days if I'm not satisfied with the outcome.So after using the ombudsmans services my issue is still not resolved and I'm literally back to where I started.",Yes,27-Oct-21,"Hello, We are sorry to hear that you feel the remedies to your complaint have not been implemented correctly.

A claim of legitimate premise was clearly demonstrated, this being that the energy-provider which sold energy to the first-tenant at our address was responsible for both gas and electricity; the energy-rates clearly deducible as false, in addition to the fact that the equipment at this house had been checked-off as fine, means the false readings had to point to other houses as having been the chain-reaction causal of issues at this one, all this information linking back to the regional supplier  - the company held as accountable in relation to the first request for investigation - and revealing them as complicit.Highlighted in the report was negligence at the hands of various branches of local government, also, which correlated with the result.Told that I could still send in a gas-energy complaint, I asked of them whether such a submission would result in the same outright dismissal, to which they simply repeated the same excuses.",Yes,22-Jun-20,"Hello, we're sorry you are unhappy with our decision.

The way these people talk to customers is shocking and their idea of resolving my issue was to give me my pack code so I can leave without trying to resolve my issue and I was not giving up without a fight, and certainly was not going to leave with them saying it was a handset issue.Anyway I finally proved it was an issue with the network in the area where the mass needed upgrading and bear in mind I leave right next to the canary wharf and live in an area that's meant to be in a 4g area and network is meant to be great, well far from that, my first point is it took me a whole year to prove I was right and after a year of giving examples after examples, The ops team as they called them finally came back and said the mass is degraded and it needs updating, I'm still waiting for it to be updated and I'm still facing no service on many occasion and I continue to face 2g and 3g network.these people that work in complaints are so dammed rude and the manager does allow you to speak she talks over the customers, the guy in her team is so smug, rude and obnoxious I feel he knows he can get away with this with me as its over the phone, probably best its just over the phone.I have been a loyal customer for many years since the days of the company being Life mobile, where they actually treated the customer with value and respect and in turn, I was always happy and if there was ever a problem they would go out there way to help the customer, But and there's a But because since this company Plusnet has taken over they no pride themselves on good customer services, they actually think its ok to patronize customers who are 100% in the right. This company does not care one bit about there customers, now the number you call 500 from your mobile where you speak to the customer service for general problems, are sometimes ok well some of them are ok and I'm always happy to speak with people who are polite and helpful and I have even had some admit how the Plusnet complaints team have no intention of helping customers and have seemed to have lost the respected customer deserve, I would say to avoid this company at all cost, And if you do read this review or don't take it on board you will certainly find out your self how disrespectful Plusnet are, and how extremely poor their service is, you have a lot of people there that are extremely rude, the guy in the complaints department should be sacked for the way he treated me, it seems all of them are completely incompetent, and the way of dealing with complaints is to hand you the pack code and send you on your merry way.I never once got a sincere apology from anyone iv sent 3 to 4 emails to the CEO about the complaints team and never had one reply back from him, iv tried to make a complaint about the team in the complaints department both with the CEO and complaints them selfs and been told the women in the complaints team and her co-workers who I want to complain about are the highest points of contact, so I am being completely ignored by everyone in this company, I took my complaint to an ombudsman and they seem to work hand in hand with each other. The Ombudsman service is meant to be a place where they are not onesided with any company but for this Ombudsman Services that deal with the mobile issues, its seems they take priority for the Plusnet company over customers. The ombudsman is basically saying because Plusnet is not the direct suppliers and have offered my pack code that there not liable to have to fix my issue and don't have to offer me any compensation. The mobile ombudsman is just as bad as Plusnet as they seem to look after each other.As you can find out by looking at the ombudsman service reviews,where people have taken complaints regarding Plusnet and being back to square one or even worse off if you were offered any compensation.I feel this review is very important for anyone looking to join this disgraceful company, I'm on a very old package with the old prices and want EE to help but unfortunately, because I'm not with EE, they are telling me Plusnet should be doing a lot more to help get my issues resolved.I may have no option at some point but to completely leave, and seems as does this is what they want me to do.But if I do leave it will be on my terms and when I'm ready to do so.What kind of company tells the customer to leave instead of trying to resolve an issue and trying to help the customer, never known a company like it.Ok so your not working side by side well just look at the other reviews, there other people who have had to take their issues to the ombudsman and had their complaint rejected, it’s such a shame Plusnet feel it’s ok to treat customers like crap and leave them no choice but to take their complaints to the ombudsman and because you guys don’t own the EE network you simply say your limited in what you can do, I suggest people to go directly with EE it another provider if that’s the case. But at least Plusnet could treat customers with the respect they deserve instead they treat their customers like rubbish.This review has been a long time coming, you know the team in the mobile department that deal with complaints, I won’t mention any names as I don’t wanna breach the terms and conditions of my trust pilot account. I don’t do Facebook but I’m sure you know who I am, Plusnet really has treated me bad and as a long time customer I don’t deserve the treatment I been given. Let me put it like this I been a customer longer than anyone of you has been working there, I joined as a life mobile customer and so for someone that’s one of the oldest customers and for all the years I’ve been a loyal paying customer do I deserve to be treated better??I hope people wake up to this awful company        The Ombudsman services refused to offer me any compensation even does Plusnet offered me £100 and because Plusnet wouldn't give me a time frame for my service network to be working normallyand I wanted to know when the mass would be fixed I took my complaint to the Ombudsman services only for the  Ombudsman services to refuse to offer me any compensation at all even doe Plusnet had already agreed £100 before I took it to an ombudsman The Ombudsman services lost me £100 and told be a Plusnet don't need to give me a time frame of the network being repaired and im free to leave them, at any time Ombudsman Services is a fraud and treat the public very unfair at least they should have offered me something for being without any service for over a year, instead, I walked away worse off than i was before I opened my complaint.I walked away with no compensation and for me to be told that Plusnet doesn't have to give me any information about the mass being fixed and don't have to contact EE to find anything out for me. Now Plusnet complaints team refuse to even help me in regards to having no service and chasing up EE.I now have a separate issue in regards to my G network with Plusnet and how I rarely get 4G coverage in a 4G area, Let's see how this plans out as I Plusnet tried to say its the same complaint when it's clearly a complaint about 4G and not receiving it.Ombudsman Services denied my new complaint because they much rather side with the big companies and not with the poor out of pocket customers, they really need to start listening to the customer a lot more than the sneaky companies. I have requested that they not deny my complaint because of it a new complaint and nothing to do with my old complaint.I will keep you all posted and add more in due time /////////",Yes,29-May-19,"Hello.

United Kingdom,8,1,05-Mar-19,3,1,2019,Incompetent ENERGY OMBUDSMAN,"The way that I have been treated by the energy ombudsman is absolutely appalling. The reason that I went to them in the first place was to get help regarding a company called Economy Energy.Being trying to get a refund of money that was owed to me and went through the proper channels etc of giving this company time to settle. Middle of December and the case was ready for investigation. Phoned them today to see what was happening. Now because this company folded in early January I was told today that there was nothing that could be done now regarding this as they are awaiting further updates from ofgem.How do I go about trying to claim my money back now. Will you give me an answer to this email as you are an absolute joke as far as I’m concerned.Privately funded company that’s fundamentally being run by the energy companies . That’s why you will not punish these companies more severely. Never bite the hand that feed you comes to mind.What do I do next because today you were an absolute joke. If you expected me to know that all the time that I spent chasing this company was for nothing according to you as they have now ceased trading.Where was the correspondence from you in keeping me up to date regarding a situation like this .You see,you should know better than us regarding what’s happening in the energy field. After today I’ve came to the conclusion that you know very little about nothing. ECONOMY ENERGY SHOULD BE HELD TO ACCOUNT FOR THE WAY THAT THE COMPANY WAS RUN.  Con men stealing people’s money and OFGEM doing zilch.My time has been wasted by your incompetence.It is now you who I shall be making a complaining against.",Yes,11-Mar-19,"Hi Robby.

United Kingdom,2,5,02-Aug-21,8,3,2021,I rated the Ombudsman's service a two,"I rated the Ombudsman's service a two. If you did a tad of research, you find the people who pay them, are the very companies we complain about. The Ombudsman service is a private profit making business, and like all businesses have to make profit. Company registration number: 4351294 VAT registration number: 798 3441 79 My complaint was against British gas. They took from me, over a two-month period, nearly £700.00. Because they took over a company who'd allegedly gone bust, but are still trading to this day. BS, didn't contact me and had no contract with me, although they say they did, but to date haven't proved any of it to me. The first I knew, was when I received a massive overestimated bill. After many months on the phone to BS, with offshore call centres, got nowhere. Threats of legal action against me, called me a racist for asking a surname, and had phone calls ended after 45mins wait to talk to an operator. All I received was £50.00 in compensation from the Ombudsman's service for my time and trouble, although they say in their literature, they can issue much more in compensation, up to £10,000. I'd like to hear from anyone who received anywhere near that figure.British Gas, took the £50.00 compensation off a final bill, and I had to pay them even more, although British Gas admit they had no contract with me in the first place. The only winner in all this is them, what a scam. So for all my months on the phone and accusations laid at my feet, fifty quid (which I didn't see a penny of) was the outcome. Well worth complaining, NOT.ETA: You say you're not for profit. You have to make money somehow to pay your staff, and I bet your senior staff are not short on top pay. You insult me with £50.00, waste my time and cosy up to your paymasters not to offend them. What we, the consumer, wants is fairness. British Gas took from me nearly £700.00 and a final bill of £70.00, quick maths test, 770-50 =720. Hmm, I think they lost nothing, and I paid plenty. Scam, that's all it is a scam. You know it, now we know it. I won't bother you again, there's no point. The only reason we use you in the first place, is because we cannot afford to sue them through the courts, where they would have lost big time in my case. No contract was in place, they had no authority or legal standing to bill me. Yet you decide and sided with British Gas, that Ofgem told them to do it. Ofgem has no legal standing over me, they can tell British Gas what to do, but not me. The right thing to do,  when they get it wrong, is to make it clear by way of a good compensation and not the poultry sum you offered myself and, by all accounts, others on here who say the same. There was nothing wrong with your operator and did her work well, her hands will be tied by your procedures. I don't want your apologies or your thanks, for this feed back, it's not meant for you.",Yes,01-Aug-21,"Hi Hurley, We are sorry that you are unhappy with the experience you had when using our service.

United Kingdom,3,1,30-May-21,5,2,2021,Would you use an ombudsman recommended by the company you're in dispute with?,"You wouldn't? Well bad luck. You have to!!I optimistically requested help from the ombudsman when I was trapped in a contract by THREE. You probably know the ruse yourself. An offer of a great price mobile broadband contract for two years. You sign up and get a virtually worthless connection and zero help from THREE's indian call centre staff. You then find yourself deeply out of pocket as well as not being able to use the internet.Who do you have to turn to for help? The ombudsman of course. Good luck with that LOL.They were so bad they ended up admitting it and had to pay me compensation. Just £40.00 but what the hell? They can afford it giving what they earn from the big conglomerates. It took so long to resolve my case that by the time the ombudsman finally conceded I was in the right and could cancel my contract it had taken an eight further months!!! I am not joking. And I still had to pay a whopping 40 percent of my contract. And I was in the right!!I submitted a swathe of evidence but might as well have been asking a fraudster's best friend for help.By the time I could cancel my contract THREE had taken me for a further £100 and were still trying to hit me for more months later. I wisely cancelled my direct debit. THREE have been grovelling to me ever since. Asking me how they can put things right. Help them to see where they went wrong blah blah blah. Why? Because BBC watchdog have responded to a letter I sent to them. They are asking me for details of the way I was treated by both THREE and their chums at the Ombudsman. Hopefully a programme is in the pipeline where our voices can be heard. Let the programme hear your grievance.Also, to the smarmy person who responds so patronisingly to reviews on here, implying that the aggrieved customer doesn't really understand the role of the ombudsman. I understand it perfectly thanks. Perhaps take a look at your own understanding of the service. You might not like what you are. And more importantly, what you've become.My advice to customers is to not take the Ombudsman's word for anything. You are the one paying for a service and if you're not getting it then don't let anybody tell you to stop being silly and let the corporation's handle it. They won't.Also, write to trading standards and more importantly BBC watchdog. Tell them how badly you're being treated. They might not be able to solve your particular case but if enough people contact them then something might be done on a grander scale to bring these money sucking reprobates and their weak kneed lackeys like the ombudsman to account.Good luck and don't let anybody tell you that your complaint isn't valid. Once you've got over the hurdle of the Ombudsman don't forget BBC watchdog. Good luck and stay strong.***My complaint wasn't resolved. I had an unfair decision forced on me.

United Kingdom,16,1,30-Apr-21,4,2,2021,Biased toward the big energy…,"Biased toward the big energy companies. EDF, whom I inherited from the dreaded iSupply want over £8,000 for one year of electricity. At one point they even said I owed £148,000 for the 18 month dispute! Another call that rised £178,000! So now that they have lowered it, the attitude is 'Computer says £8,000. What's the problem? Why are you being so willful? Just pay up.""... 1 person living in the house. Gone 3 months last year. Clearly, I'm just being awkward and trying to get out of paying what I owe. No actually that is not the case.Ombudsman Services have upheld the demand. They have done no site investigation. They just said:1.I use a lot of electricity. 2.I have three-phase electricity.Yes, as one person in a large house, historically the bills are a lot compared to one person in a small one-bedroom. So yes my bills were £1,400 to £1,700 (for which I provided this evidence) in previous years and that's comparatively a lot. However, they were NOT '£8,000 a lot'. Their investigator claims one of the things that prove I am a big energy user is that I have Three-phase electricity. The only reason the property HAD three-phase electricity many years ago is because the place used to be a working pottery. This was in the 70's and 80's before I bought it and it. They never asked me about this.Their investigator also estimates that I use almost £4,000 per year, so the £5,500 when the dispute started was overflow and iSupply just told me I was at £0 when they closed my account and gave me a new tariff to be nice... So although iSupply was getting meter readings all those years that they were somehow miscalculating and not telling me I was using more, it is my fault and I am supposed to pay over £8,000??... And what about the many years before that I have owned the house. All these years I am still freezing in here and getting chilblains in the winters, but I suddenly started using a king's ransom in electricity.Nearly a year of hassle and terrible stress, from countless calls to EDF and iSupply is worth a sorry letter and £50?I have occasional guests, true. But I am one person living in my home with most of the home shut up throughout the year and I have been away for extended periods. A large family doesn't use this amount of electricity! Neither the large pub nor the small hotel I spoke to use this much. No one at the Ombudsman or EDF thinks this is odd or worthy of giving me a new metre.UPDATE: OMBUDSMAN SERVICES TRIED TO STOP THIS HONEST REVIEW BEING SEEN BY ANYONE...Ombudsman Services reported to Trustpilot that I did not actually have any dealings with them and made the review up. They asked Trustpilot to hide my review on this basis.

We understand how stressful these situations can be and that this may feel like a long process when you are in the middle of dealing with a complaint, but our team will always try their best to resolve the case as quickly as possible. We are glad to hear your complaint is resolved and would like to thank you for leaving us a review.",-20
United Kingdom,12,1,01-Apr-21,4,2,2021,Ombudsman are a waste of time,"Ombudsman are a waste of time, I had problems with my Internet from bt. The ombudsman took bt's side in everything that was said. I went weeks with no Internet. Then ombudsman had the nerve to say I'd had 77.00 compensation from bt and it was more then he would've awarded me. If you bothered to take notice it was my refund as I'd overpaid for my service not compensation as you claim. He also noted I'd had high Internet usage for 1 month, so right then. What about the months when I had no Internet and paying for a service I didn't receive? So that makes it okay then. Also bt lied saying that they'd sent me a letter out to which I'd not received but ombudsman took their word for it. Also bt claim that openreach couldn't find any fault when they came to check my broadband. So why was it not working then? It doesn't just stop working for nothing!. 5 engineers it took to finally sort it out. What a complete joke and ombudsman agreed with bt on everything. They also agreed with bt saying that bt had sent an 8 week deadline letter out saying i could take my case to the ombudsman.  despite this M H decided that bt had responded to my complaints in a timely manner and also sent this letter out. Just liars the lot of them and ombudsman believe everything they say. I think these ombudsman must be paid by these companies so they're not going to disagree with the companies are they. Ombudsman closed my case as I declined their decision as they took bts side.

I complained and was assured that the mistake would be corrected. It wasn't and they transferred my account. I complained again and it took them weeks to get my account back. Additionally, I started getting written bills for another account holder to my home address. I complained  and was asked to provide evidence of my residence at my own address! I have owned the house from new! Was also asked to photograph my meters for serial numbers etc. OVO never explained how they allowed someone else to register for energy supply at an address already registered to an existing customer. Finally OVO confirmed I was still a customer. The Ombudsman rep was lightweight and after deliberation conceded that OVO had been at fault. I was awarded £150 and told it was top end of average! Whar does that mean? Average shouldn't be the deciding factor, it should be the merits of the case. Pretty hopeless and clearly weighted towards the energy suppliers.",Yes,07-Apr-21,"Hi Paul, We are sorry that you weren't happy with your experience whilst using our services. We understand that Erroneous transfers can be concerning for the customer involved, however the industry does have processes in place to ensure that the supply can be returned back to the original supplier and billed as though the transfer never took place.  As part of our investigation into these types of complaints, we identify whether the supplier followed the correct processes and returned the supply within the agreed timescales.  A goodwill gesture payment can vary depending on the situation and this is considered on a case by case basis.

United Kingdom,4,1,30-Mar-21,3,1,2021,Shocking experience.,"Just don't bother, people! Honestly, just a waste of time and energy :(I opened a  case back in November and only today I received a very bad response, annulling all my efforts trying to explain what happened with three mobile company.Long story short, was victim of two consecutive phone scams, was stolen my number twice in the same way (through a PAC number sent by text). This led to a bank fraud and lot of money being withdrawn from my account. I asked three to cancel my contract and they categorically refused.Mr Amandeep Randhawa was the investigator who made the decision and he greatly twisted the story, omitted some important facts (like the fact that I did ask three to cancel my contract and was willing to pay fees in the first place) and said inaccurate unfounded stuff about myself.I felt NO empathy at all coming from this person, I actually wondered if perhaps he had some connections with people who work for three, because his words were extremely biased. The funny part is that he asked me to clear the 5 months outstanding balance with three, after the Ombudsman customer service themselves told me that my account would be suspended while the case was open!! And I waited 5 months for them to do something about my case!Shocking! I appealed the decision and I'm now expecting to wait for 5 extra months, before they reply again.

United Kingdom,5,1,13-Jan-21,1,1,2021,The ombudsman is there to help the supplier,"The bottom line here is don’t bother with them as they always take the side of the supplier. Together energy continually failed to swap me over and despite promises that they would follow it up, never did. Once it went to the ombudsman they made an offer to get me on the new tariff as soon as possible and give a £50 credit (which in no way compensated me for the time spent). Because it was a yes/no I had no alternative but to accept or I would be seen to be unreasonable. The day before the 4 week time limit was up Together sent a letter although they had done nothing. When I complained that the issue had not been resolved and none of the actions had been done, the ombudsman said that the matter was resolved so they couldn’t do anything and rejected my response. The system is geared towards the energy companies. It is in their interest when there is a problem not to do anything about it and if a complaint is made they can make a derisory offer knowing that the ombudsman will back them if you reject it and then they can renege on any agreements with impunity as long as they send a letter.",Yes,20-Jan-21,"Hello Chris,  Thank you for taking the time to provide us with this feedback.We are sorry that you are unhappy with your experience.

I am sure there are some quite competent/diligent ones although I have not yet come across any. This coupled with the fact that the major suppliers of energy are notorious for their appalling customer service makes it a toxic combination. As others may have mentioned there is an internal complaints procedure but just how independent that is is open to doubt.Following my review on the 6th December the Ombudsman gave the usual stock reply without even checking the facts or reading the review. The review mentioned an internal complaints procedure (or appeal). Indeed had anyone in the ombudsman's office bothered to check they would have realised that a complaint or appeal had actually been made. The initial response to the complaint (or appeal) however was not to treat it as a complaint (which was against their own policy) but to simply pass the matter back to the people against whom the complaint was being made.

United Kingdom,2,1,16-Nov-20,11,4,2020,I found them to be largely ineffective,"I found them to be largely ineffective.  I don't understand why. E.on is still trying to over-bill me.Though they've gone from asking £500 for a few weeks,£600 for a year is still too much when the bill should be under £400. The Ombudsman is absolutely sleeping on the job. E.on can't bill correctly even once a year now. The matter is still unresolved.*********  Update 21/05/2021  *********About a year and a half later EON is still trying to overcharge me - the total is now about £900 for I think 5 three-month periods.I suspect, given the progression of the bills, the overcharging is concentrated in the last quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020.I can only suspect, since getting clear data from EON is like squeezing cheese from a rock.The last quarter may be for about £100, which sounds about right.I did ask EON last week to send me an individual bill for each quarter. (so I could pay the bills that are sane). They said yes, but... instead sent me a phone bot that runs on what seems to be an endless loop.At this point I can only conclude that:a. somebody at EON is trying desperately to cover up all the mistakes they have made (and lies).b. EON overcharges its small customers because they can get away with it. (with the assistance of the Ombusman).Update 05 July 2021More than a year and a half later E.ON are still trying to overcharge me....£1,121.80 for about 18 months.compare that to the£352.93 for 12 months I paid in 2018!The scam? They pretend to charge me 'NORMAL' tariff (1 meter reading) but in fact are charging me 'DAY & NIGHT' (2 different meter readings!).instead of about 1800 kwh/yearthey get over 3000 kwh/yearI think they are trying to cover it up by passing the buck to a debt collection agency(I wonder if they know they are being scammed too)Meanwhile the Energy Ombudsman is fast asleep.",Yes,24-Nov-20,"Hello, we're sorry you are unhappy with the result of your complaint.

United Kingdom,2,1,12-Nov-20,11,4,2020,Not fit for purpose,"Normally I would assume so many bad reviews were the result of people being understandably angry that their cases had not gone in their favour. Now that I have experienced an ""impartial"" investigation by the Ombudsman Services, I know from experience that they are not fit for purpose.I approached them after reaching a deadlock with a complaint with a former energy provider. I provided the requested evidence to support my case, the energy provider has refused to provide any evidence to support their argument. Nevertheless, the Ombudsman ruled in their favour. I appealed, was rejected, requested a review and was rejected again. This whole process has taken 3 1/2 months.Crucially, during my appeals process, both the IO and SIO admitted in writing that they do not require service providers to provide any evidence and will always take them at their word. The onus is entirely on the consumer to prove otherwise, despite acknowledging that, as was in my case, the passage of time might render this an unreasonable request.It might be a necessary evil to go through this process to bolster your case when you inevitably take it to court, but be warned - it will be a long and stressful process.I strongly recommend to anyone thinking of engaging the Ombudsman Services to use their time wisely. The list of bodies who regulate them are listed here on their website:www (dot) ombudsman-services (dot) org/about-us/regulationBe prepared to lodge a complaint with any or all of them. Furthermore, raise it with your MP:members (dot) parliament (dot) uk/members/commonsIf you feel your data has been mishandled, you can lodge a complaint with the ICO:ico (dot) org (dot) uk/make-a-complaint/In short, don't expect the Ombudsman Services to carry out an impartial investigation.

Given our experience with this particular energy company ... we were at our wits end and if it hadn't been for Amie and her calm and professional handling of our case , I am quite sure we would still be shackled to this energy company and their unbelievable treatment of us would have continued .Myself and my husband are profoundly grateful to Amie - her investigative work has enabled us to be able to finally move on from this difficult chapter in our lives .",Yes,05-Dec-19,Thank you for your feedback.

Instead the Investigating Officer decided to introduce his own scenario that it was not my current meter which was faulty but it was infact my previous one. But despite introducing this faulty meter into the complaint, he decided there was no action required by the Utility company. I was then given the choice of accepting that Utility company had no action to take, or rejecting the decision in which case the Utility company were not bound by the decision, to take no action! On questioning the decision I was then "" timed out"" of the deadline by the Investigating Officer being on holiday, resulting in the Ombudsman Service contacting the Utility Company to tell them I had failed to respond!Despite the Ombudsman Service having a procedure for appeals and service complaints, the whole system is rendered irrelevant by the fact that the same person who carries out the investigation, also carries out any appeal and yes you have guessed it, handles any complaint about how the investigation is handled. Imagine having a job where you can make a bad decision, then handle any appeal and complaint about it without anyone else being involved. Unaccountability not even enjoyed by a High Court Judge!

United Kingdom,22,1,25-Oct-19,10,4,2019,A MAJOR WASTE OF TIME & EFFORT!,"A MAJOR WASTE OF TIME & EFFORT!13.11.19 Update ... I would take not a blind bit of notice of the 'sound bite' response to my truthful Review.  The data on Complaints is widely reported and it further confirms they don't have a grip of the situation. It is a much cheaper route to pay the Ombudsman than compensate an aggrieved Customer.  Avoidance of Liability and Responsibility, at any cost is the 'Name of the Game' with Corporations now.  It has become part of their 'business model'.'Strive' to make the right decisions???  Based on what's best for their Industry NOT what is in the best interests of the aggrieved Customer!Their 'claim' to 'help' is ambiguous and their idea of 'help' does not mean a successful resolution for the Customer.------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Ombudsman 'Service' whether it be Energy or Financial are sadly a complete waste of time.And although this ‘service’ is advertised as ‘free and unbiased’ it is neither.  Customers of course are paying for these Quango operations through the Fees we are paying to the Companies we are having to complain about!   They collude and co-operate with the Industries they are clearly expected to protect.  At the whiff of a Complaint, companies now fob you off, straight away to the Ombudsman as a matter of course.  As a result the extraordinary high level of Complaints Ombudsman now receive, +/- 5,000 per day which is an awful lot of very Dissatisfied and Unhappy Customers (!) they are simply just another part of the frustrating 'go round in circles, wear you down' avoidance strategy. The language Ombudsman Operatives use is always vague, non committal, confusing and evasive.  Actually supporting the aggrieved Customer just doesn't happen even when its blindingly obvious they should be doing so. They happily 'Big Up' their authority to give them some sort of importance and then 'Down Play' it when it comes to making any 'fair and reasonable' decisions to create solutions which, heaven forbid, might result in them actually having to award justified Compensation or Recompense!Ombudsman Staff have clearly been working in their respective Industries for too long and are definitely in denial about the bad service, misrepresentation, deceptiveness and inefficiency that is rife in their respective market sectors.   It's an unacceptable and poor state of affairs.  The Ombudsman should be trashed and replaced with a far more balanced 'Watch Dog' or Trustpilot company instead off a wishy washy, blue sky thinking, jobs worth one!",Yes,13-Nov-19,"Hi Frances,Really sorry to read your review. As Ombudsman Services we operate the Energy Ombudsman scheme - the Financial Ombudsman  Service (FOS) is a completely separate and distinct organisation with which we have no links. We aren't sure where the '5,000 complaints a day' figure comes from but this doesn't tally with our data. It's interesting that you feel companies are too quick to ""fob"" people off to ourselves - companies must pay us a fee for every complaint we handle so it's in their commercial interests to try to resolve as many complaint as possible in-house without referral to an ombudsman. From your review it seems unlikely that we will change your mind about us and the service we provide, but what we can say is that we always strive to make the right decisions in cases.

The site seems quite organised and easy to access but the outcome proved that it was obviously biased towards Npower which makes perfect sense because Npower was encouraging me to contact them to solve the issue.I complained to Npower about my bill being tooo high for no reason- and they called me after a week to say that I've actually been overpaying and I am due over £600 back in 7-10 working days. Obviously, that money never came through so I chased it up and they simply said that the information was incorrect and shouldn't have been given to me but would give me £50 for compensation (Which I hope I get as others in these reviews are saying otherwise). From Ombudsmans outcome - Npower admitted their mistake by listening in the phone call but had absolutely no logical explanation to the information given to me by the advisor so Ombudsman came up with a weaker excuse to cover Npower but giving no sympathy whatsoever towards the customer.",Yes,07-Nov-19,"Hello, we're sorry you've had a bad experience.

How can this be...as my contract was with BT and their defective supply chain is surely their problem and not mine?In my several LA complaints  in regard of fly tipping; the Ombudsman shockingly found in favour of the LA despite clear and substantial evidence evidence that they failed in their Service level agreements over several years.

Here the Ombudsman told me I was vexatious as I needed to complain to them more than once about the LA.Finally; don't waste time with ineffectual, interlocutory Ombudsman Services who appear to side with big business and has no power in any case.

You feel relieved at first that there is an ‘independent’ company willing to listen to your concerns however, don’t be fooled! You’ll waste your precious time gathering all your evidence & submitting it on the most cumbersome portal I think I’ve ever come across - it’s not user friendly at all. Once you done that (as if you’ve not spent enough time on your complaint with the retailer) you’ll get a resolution date 6 months in the future. You wait patiently only for the date that THEY set to be surpassed. You chase frequently over a period of 2 weeks by calling and emailing your complaint handler just to be ignored. You can only leave a voicemail if you call. They don’t answer the phone & you have to wait 24 hours for a reply. If you send them a PM on fb, they’ll respond so you have a glimmer of hope. You’ll then speak to someone who says your case will be resolved by the end of the week & that they have just been busy. If, like me, you now fear a rushed result, you’ll state you only ever wanted to be kept in the loop & don’t wish to have a rushed resolution. You’ll be assured it won’t be, only for that afternoon to receive a decision (which again wasn’t easy to find on the portal!) telling you it’s gone in favour of the supplier with NO explanation as to how they reached such a decision. British Gas’ actions could have killed us and their shoddy workmanship, supported by photographic proof, still meant the ombudsman rules in their favour. You have no where left to turn unless you want to pay out more money & they know this. They are useless & not fit for purpose. I only wished I had read the reviews prior to sending my submission.

Further, they said my Gas reading has not been coming up since 2017, and that they will be sending me a reversed bill from 2017 to January 2019.I was so upset that I logded a complaint there and then. my question is this: why would edf wait until when I intend to switch that they will come up with a thing like this? why would they give me estimated bills since 2017 when I have smart meter? why would I have to pay a reversed bill of £631 for something that is their fault? why did they fail to see that the Gas meter wasn't coming up since the installation of the smart meter like they claim? I have gone through so many reviews here a moment ago and never find a positive one, I hope my complaint would not be like others. edf asked me to contact the OS I guess they are thinking they would be on their side like they have always been based on the comments I have read here.Hoping that mine will be a positive outcome for me and I look forward to sharing a positive outcome here soon.",Yes,14-Feb-19,Hi Caroline.

This is whilst they consistently pervert the course of justice, because they think that they can continue perverting the course of justice, being above the law.Probably, the only solution is to become powerful enough and create a system to deal with the culprits in the long term.They have initiated world war three, so be it.",Yes,14-Feb-19,"Hello.

United Kingdom,7,1,07-Jan-19,1,1,2019,Defeated,"After sharing very sensitive medical info which was very important in the context of my complaint, their final decision was still in favour of British Gas which have been nothing less than misleading and dishonest. The caseworker/decision never verified the info thoroughly, took it all at face value to base his in their favour, He also totally dismissed my medical issued which were central to the case as an after-thought in the last paragraph as if they were mere excuses. Only his manager has shown a willingness to understand and allow to write a detailed rebuttal to his decision. They have been made aware that I am struggling with mental health issues as a well as learning difficulties and that as a result, it might take me a little longer to get back to them. Today, I received another generic email informing me that the case would be closed as I had rejected their offer??? I called to explain that I have been sending emails to let them know that I needed more time as I was (and still is) struggling with my health and personal life but was still putting together the rebuttal with supporting evidence. I never received a reply until today! I just got off the phone with an agent who seemed more concerned about arguing my points and justify herself as well as her organisation's shortcomings than helping me as their customer. Insensitive and certainly not geared up to help vulnerable customers. These guys are meant to support customers, yet they have added to the stress caused by British Gas. The experience has left me feeling disempowered and anxious. It has to be said whilst I can find the words to voice my experience.",Yes,16-Jan-19,"Hi, thanks for taking the time to leave a review.

United Kingdom,5,2,23-Oct-18,10,4,2018,Disappointing,"Disappointing. A poor, inconsistent service, though I suspect it's more because of workload than intention. Still, it doesn't excuse doing a bad job just because you're busy... and free.In a nutshell, they wouldn't explain themselves over the decisions they made over my case and the remedy they offered was just a token cash offer I felt was just to palm me off - an insult seeing as I never even asked for money in the first place. I sent them page after page after page of information - screenshots, webchats, emails, documents, criteria and the credo behind my complaint and reasons why and they made their decision citing only half the facts, dismissing the ones most important to me. They didn't even give any valid reasoning behind why they made their decision, they just said this is this and that is that. So then I appealed, outlining the most important points and in their final decision they got the other half of the facts wrong and ignored the first half. Still no reasoning though - in my case they were contradictory too.I though my case was so straight forward, obviously I was wrong. An energy company manufactured a complaint, said it was from me and recorded it in their database as me complaining. I objected to this, asked them to remove it and they said no, so I got the Ombudsman Services - Energy on the case and the Ombudsman said: Yeah, that's okay, they can say you made a complaint if they want to. So I asked if they could get the energy company to promise it wouldn't happen again, seeing as I specifically told them at the time: 'No, I'm not complaining, I don't want to make a complaint.' FOUR TIMES !!! and I don't want it to happen again if I have to call them.... and the Ombudsman said: Nah, it's unreasonable to expect them to promise not to do it again. Like, WHAT ???They may be impartial but the Ombudsman Service doesn't seem to follow any kind of common sense when it comes to people's rights and explaining WHY they think consumers are wrong. I mean... They've told me this energy company can record me as making as many complaints as they like EVEN WHEN I SAY I'M NOT COMPLAINING. And the Ombudsman Service say they don't think that's unreasonable, or say why they think that. Incredible.My opinion - A good idea but they've lost their way.Edit: 30/10/18 - When I asked about the 'looking into' OS offered in their reply below they would not even commit to there being a possibility it could lead to re-opening my case. If they can't even entertain the idea they might have made a mistake, what point is there in offering a review?Addendum: 30/10/18 - As I already explained to you OS, that's not enough for me. I need to know there would be a possibility, however remote, that the review into your performance could lead to a re-opening of my case before entering into such a potentially long-winded and stressful process of examination and interpretation. Think of it like this: I want a diagnosis, and you can only offer a post mortem. Think about it.",Yes,30-Oct-18,"Hi John. We would like to look into this for you.

United Kingdom,1,1,08-Oct-18,10,4,2018,So wish I had read these reviews before…,"So wish I had read these reviews before bothering with the Energy Ombudsman.  From how my complaint was handled with the Investigation Officer it is clear that this Ombudsman is not in favour of the consumer.  The Officer did not ask me any questions throughout the investigation and when I checked out two things he put in his report with the company in question it turned out that he was wrong.  His response was that it was a typo.. a full sentence a typo?  In the call to the company in question they told me some stuff that was new and contradicted what they had put in their final response to me.  I emailed this new evidence to the investigation Officer.  I might as well not have bothered because from what I can see once they make a decision at the Ombudsman they are not for turning.  My experience with these people is not good.  You basically need a law degree to understand exactly how you should set out your complaint because if you don't put it in in the beginning they just don't want to know. The process has put me through more stress and wasted my time.  The outcome was in my favour but the compo won't even come to me it will go on the bill I was disputing. Not only that It seems in 21st century UK the big Energy companies can make mistakes, the Ombudsman can make mistakes on what they call a through investigation but we Joe Public are not allowed to.  I should have just took SSE to court.  This process has left me feeling stupid, undervalued, frustrated and ignored with no where else to go.  They need real reform in these areas.",Yes,22-Oct-18,Hi.

United Kingdom,3,1,18-Sep-18,9,3,2018,Fake service and certainlly for profit!,"The most terrible City of London backed ""fake"" not-for-profit organisation I have had the misfortune of dealing with. It's clear that the ombudsmans employees know that it is the energy companies themselves paying for their wages. This is just another example of the Oxbridge Alumini scratching each others back throughout British governance. When are we going to have a properly run democratic system that punishes the corruption and inadequacies in these companies and forces them to reform?Reply to Ombudsman:My case file is handled by possibly the most useless person I have had to deal with in a professional matter. This person managed to completely ignore that I actually had a gas account with ""British Gas"" in her report and that the complaint was predominantly about Gas. Then did nothing, even when it was pointed out to her. She thought £100 which British Gas agreed to pay for an initial error from Nov to Feb was enough and that the next series of problems (6 Months of emails/calls) and still no rectification of the first issue warrants no award. So what the ombudsman is telling people is that they should expect to waste days of their time and have all this additional stress to their daily lives and it is completely fine?my case file: OS:01013002336741Also your figures don't even take into account the 1000's of people like myself who realise that your service is a complete waste of time and never deal with you or don't formulate a complaint due to it being a waste of even more of their time!

I know the law in this area, I am a (non practising) solicitor.You would think that a dispute resolution service involved in settlement of ongoing disputes would understand the basics of the law governing their business.  They do not.I had to explain partial settlement to each and every individual I discussed the problem with.  60% of those I did explain the issue to did not understand or refused to take on board the points being made.  I was eventually handed to an Investigating Officer who I did have chance to explain the points to, and she understood...At last, progress, or so you might think...Only to have the review passed to another who completely ignored the (tightly written) brief for investigation and completely failed to illicit evidence from BT relating to the dispute.Found in BTs favour when they were clearly acting unlawfully.

Like many others here, I'v had a really disturbing experience. Being in poor health for last several years, with long hospitalisations made it difficult to be on top of things.  However,  while recuperating away from home I decided to do long outstanding admin. BT offered me approx half of £200+ extracted from my account for an UNACTIVATED SIM.  The Ombudsman decided I should get even less than that. The tone of his correspondence is also quite condecending. I searched google for ""Ombudsman BT FRAUD SCAM"" and found this site and others. It is good to know I am not alone, but very concerned that the Ombudsman service is desperately failing the public in general and anyone vulnerable in particular.  Anyone else suspects a revolving door scam: where the Ombudsman gets employed eventually by BT??? or worse is paid off in cash or kind to make perverse decisions???VERY CONCERNED 6th August 2018Response to Reply by Ombudsman Services 21 August:You failed to be fair. You failed to be thorough. It is unlikely that you gave any serious consideration to the matter. The very many negative reviews on Trustpilot.com and elswhere of your sham operation shows that my assessnent is widely shared. It may be too late for me but I would urge others not to waste their time and effort on your disturbingly POOR service.

I made a Subject Access Request (SAR) for Ombudsmans file and discovered an historic SP secret letter admitting that this money was in fact owed, SO THE INFORMATION CONFIRMING THE OVERCHARGE WAS WITH THEM FOR THE OMBUDSMAN TO SEE (if they looked). Also revealed was SP indicating to Ombudsman that their offer to settle was £50 and an apology SO all the Ombudsman did was incompetently and negligently impose SP preferred outcome gifting my £250 to SP.  Something drastic needs to be done to bad service from utilities and those who facilitate such bad service such as Ofgem and Ombudsman Energy, I could sort bad practices out it in a week, why cant they???????!?????!PS the Obudsman business model for earnings relies on complaints so perversely the more unresolved bad practices the more fees and money they make.

Economy Energy won't tell me what tariff I'm on, or what options I have to change. Economy Energy are also preventing me from changing suppliers so I'm trapped with over-charging and their mistakes every day. I turned to the Ombudsman in March. I gave them evidence and explained my problems. They replied - repeating my problems back to me (!) - but they made mistakes - they didn't repeat them back correctly, I had to keep correcting their mistakes. Finally the Ombudsman suggested I receive £150, but I've been over-charged c £200. I've fought to get it sorted for 10 months now and the Ombudsman have delayed it a further 2 months. I've refused their suggestion of £150 as it doesn't refund the over-charging which continues every day, and it gives me nothing for compensation, so Economy Energy are laughing all the way. So the Ombudsman said they've no other suggestions and closed the case.  I am very seriously disgusted that the taxpayers (me) are paying for this organisation to do nothing at all. Now I've got to start Court proceedings, get all the evidence together all over again of months of Economy Energy failing to help despite all my letters, emails, phone calls.... and I've also got to put together all the evidence of the Ombudsman's failed attempts for the Courts.

United Kingdom,31,1,26-Jun-18,6,2,2018,A Waste of time and effort,"Any business or organisation with this percentage of 1* reviews should be thoroughly ashamed and would normally be avoided like the plague - and yet we are all directed to them for a resolution to our complaints!  As they make their money from their members they cannot possibly be unbiassed and when making their decisions they don't look at the complete picture, judging only on what they see as failures in service.  They take no notice at all of what consumers have been through with the company concerned or the effect on their lives and their awards are pathetic and not remotely punitive.  Given the time spent compiling evidence for the complaint if you work it out we are not even making minimum wage sometimes!I have taken several cases to OS now and each has been a farce.Furniture - decided in Harveys favour because they said we had not plumped and turned our sofa cushions in line with their care instructions and that is why they went flat and hard.  It was a recliner and the cushions were FIXED!  Went to the bank with a Section 75 credit card claim and received a full refund of £1200 for both sofas.Property - last stage of a complaint against a completely incompetent surveyor and with hindsight should not have taken the second (very low) offer but after 8 months had run out of steam and couldn't start again with a court case.  However the first offer against a £20k claim was £75.  Not a typo - it really does say £75.  Communications - months of wrangling with BT/Openreach over fibre broadband installation.  Same old story, complain, get deadlock letter, go to Ombudsman.  I turned down a ""goodwill gesture"" of £150 as the amount according to Ofcom should have been nearer £350 and under next year's guidelines £950.  I thought it would be good to get the complaint on record with the Ombudsman rather than let them slip under the radar but that decision cost me £100 as they offered £50 for the ""failings in service"" identified and of course don't take Openreach into account at all.  I turned it down and went back after BT under consumer law as they mis-sold the contract and ended up with £108.  I then found out that as service provider they had failed to pass on complaints to Openreach and took out a new complaint as none of my neighbours' complaints had been passed on either.  A systemic failure by BT (admitted by them in writing) has resulted in another paltry offer of £30 - less than one month's phone bill so it will hardly have them quaking in their boots!  Consumers have it worse than ever these days as there has been a massive watering down of Trading Standards due to budget cuts, the Consumer Helpline run by Citizens Advice does nothing about anything and the only advice dished out is ""go to the Ombudsman"" or ""take legal advice"" so the best option seems to be to educate yourself on the various legislations and deal with it yourself using a letter before action and the threat of the small claims court.

Some kind of bizarre Kafkaesque operation we seems to defy not just logic but also seems to have scant regard for integrity. I am told by them that it is correct that on a variable monthly account with First Utility where meter readings are submitted monthly that the price charged by First Utility monthly can bear no resemblance to the actual tariff being charged or the actual amount of energy used and that after six months or so having ignored the monthly meter readings their automated computer system via your direct debit will simply recover the amount they say you owe.During the intervening period your decision as to the tarif you should be on is rigged by your belief that the charge First Utility is making is the correct one and that you have no need to change.,Yes,21-Aug-18,"Sorry to hear that you're unhappy with our service.

United Kingdom,39,1,18-Feb-16,2,1,2016,Energy Ombudsman unprofessional,"I had hoped that the Ombudsman service would help me in resolving a complaint about my energy supplier.  Instead, the organisation is behaving in exactly the same, unacceptable manner.  My letters and emails are ignored for weeks then I'm told that I MUST provide information ""within seven days.""  Clearly, no sense of irony and a complete lack of professionalism.  Very angry and disappointed.May 2016: After hearing nothing from the Ombudsman service for four months, I received an email informing me that someone would now ""investigate"" my complaint.  Two weeks later I received the results of that investigation.  Three English graduates have read it and none of us (individually or collectively) can understand what it is trying to say.  I have asked for a translation and await a response....June 2016: After hearing nothing for yet another month I sent one more email to this organisation.  The response was  a series of increasingly rude and aggressive emails.  Parts of my complaint had been conveniently ""lost"", others have been misrepresented and, when I persisted in asking for an explanation, the case was abruptly and unilaterally closed. No-one seems to appreciate the irony that the Ombudsman service is more incompetent that the organisations it seeks to investigate.August 2016: I am still waiting for a resolution to my complaint.  In the midst of this debacle I changed my email address.  It took TWENTY messages to the Energy Ombudsman before this change was acknowledged.  In the last week I have received a message informing me that there is a document on the organisation's portal (which some members of staff use and some don't) requiring my attention.  The email contained no link to this portal and neither a site search nor a Google search reveal its existence.  I contacted the organisation by phone and was told I would receive an email containing the ""up to date information"".

United Kingdom,32,1,01-Sep-24,9,3,2024,Energy Ombudsman have little authority,"I have finally left British Gas after 10 months of absolute madness.  I realise there is no support or will on behalf of British Gas to support the roll out of EV car charging infrastructure.The support from the energy ombudsman was poor.In 10 months I had only 1 month where I was billed correctly for charging my car overnight.  Issue - Smart meter did not communicate with British Gas to tell them when I was charging my car. Off peak overnight is around 70% cheaper than peak use. It has cost me £1000.During my time:- Billed for 9/10 months at peak rate despite charging my car over night- had 2 new smart meters installed-in the end, after I thought all was resolved, BG continued to take only 1 reading as peak from my meter despite it having dual ability.- energy ombudsman have little power - can only enforce BGs appalling policies and provide token gesture compensation. It seems to me that BG are using loop holes to get around having to charge low prices for nighttime EV car charging, knowing the Ombudsman can do nothing. If they don’t receive the meter readings, they don’t need to backdate your bills - and won’t. They know the Ombudsman can do nothing. Pod Point APP which shows my overnight charge history is not accepted as evidence by BG OR THE REGULATOR.I was left with £1000 debt which I cleared with a loan.  I have have left BG to go back to Octopus. Guess what - Octopus are receiving my peak and off peak meter readings with no problem after only 4 days. All automatic. Visible on my meter.

United Kingdom,5,1,05-Jul-24,7,3,2024,Faulty meter,"Initially, the Ombudsman appeared friendly and took my claim seriously. However, months later, they closed my case without a fair review.After removing a faulty meter, Eon increased my bill and passed the costs onto me. This feels like outright robbery, and the Ombudsman did nothing to help. I ended up worse off than when I started the claim. I've spent most of my working week trying to communicate with unresponsive parties, going around in circles.Eon is exploiting customers and getting away with it. When I tried to open a new case, I was bounced back and forth between Eon and the Ombudsman, with neither wanting to deal with the issue. The main problem was the faulty meter and the back billing. Astonishingly, Eon continued charging me even after I had switched energy suppliers.I had to laugh when they billed me £800 for a couple of months' electricity usage for two full-time workers. The meter recorded night-time usage, so unless I was partying non-stop and decorating my house with Christmas lights, this is completely insane.Please save your mental health and avoid this ordeal. I apologise to anyone at their wit's end seeking answers. Eon will gaslight you and stop replying, leaving you confused and frustrated. They claim they have fulfilled the Ombudsman's list, but in my case, this was only half true and they bypassed the most important bit—the huge debt on my account.My advice is to set up a monthly direct debit for as much as you can afford; otherwise, they put a mark on your credit score even if you're not at fault. I'm in a rented property, so the meter isn't even mine, and I'm also the account holder for other people. Unfortunately, this all falls on me.As suggested by the Ombudsman, I reached out to Eon for further answers but was then told to go back to the Ombudsman. It's a never-ending cycle. By the time I open a new case in 8 weeks, I will have paid off all of the money I don't owe via direct debit. It's completely powerless and unfair. It's unfortunate things couldn't have been resolved when I first made the claim back in February. If my case hadn't been closed prematurely without investigation, I might have had the debt wiped from my account.If your bill exceeds £1,000, consider taking it to court if you can afford it.

United Kingdom,44,1,29-May-24,5,2,2024,Smart meter problems that started…,"I had smart meter problems that started in 2022 & was only resolved due to my investigation in 2024. My supplier EDF at the time I wanted smart meters fitted only came with electric smart meter to fit. I asked the fitter why not gas as had dual supply, He inquired with his manager if he could fit gas meter and was told that I had asked to switch to another supplier or they did not own the gas meter.  Eventually at a later date EDF  came and fitted the gas meter and a new electric smart meter as they need to be fitted as a pair.  The gas meter never paired with the IHD in home display and EDF never got any readings from the gas so I had to manually read. I complained and they sent me a new IHD this did not work, I complained again and they replaced both meters again and a new IHD. The gas meter still did not give any readings to EDF or the IHD. I complained again and had several engineers visit to try rebooting the meters, I even had an inspector who came to make sure the meters were fitted  O.K. He was at my house for 4 hours  trying to fix the problem. So I complained to the Energy  Ombudsman who decision was that EDF had done everything they could and that it was a technology problem that they were not liable for. I must point out that the gas meter is 1 ½ meters away from the electric meter.Early on in 2024 I applied to E on Next  to switch to them as a new supplier. Initially I got email from Sainsbury's  Energy welcoming me which I thought was strange, but the received a welcoming email from  E on Next.  I downloaded the  E on Next app and was surprised to see the details of 2 accounts one for  Sainsbury's  Energy and the other for  E on Next. I then received emails that there was a problem they could not switch the accounts from EDF, it stated “Thank you for getting in touch with us. Can I please confirm that you have not initiated a transfer of supply from EDF to E on Next? I can see that there was an attempt to take over the supply, however this would not have been an internal process. This may have been triggered by the use of comparison website to provide quotes. This application to take over the supply was rejected by EDF so we did not at point take over your supply. “ I then figured out the problem which I conveyed to E on Next That I had applied back in 2021 to switch to  Sainsbury's  Energy but had cancelled within the 14 day calling off period.  This sorted out the switching problem I was told they had to reinitiate the Sainsbury energy account then do a brand switch. They did this on the 23 February 24 and guess what EDF started getting gas readings for the first time.  The supply switch followed on the 1st March 24.  The IHD never got gas readings I complained to  E on Next but they tried to fob me off by telling me that the technology was not compatible with EDF and I would need to buy a better IHD. I had to go back over all the problems why I thought that the problem was with the Sainsbury's energy account. They eventually listened and a few weeks later the IHD started working.  After  2 months of supply  E on Next they wanted to up my Direct Debit considerably as I was paying the correct amount I phoned to state this and was told the could review Direct Debit payments when they liked and there was nothing I could do about it, I stated that I would like to speak to a manager and was told they would phone me back which they never did.  So I switched back to EDF. I complained to E  on Next on all the problems and they offered £20 but took no responsibility for any of the issues I had . So I complained to the  Energy Ombudsman again telling them of the previous complaint with EDF. I thought the Energy Ombudsman was there to act impartially and reach a fair decision based on the facts This is part off the  Energy Ombudsman decision contained in the conclusion “It is possible that when an update was sent during the change of supply process it triggered an update to the Smart meter which caused functionality to be restored. However, as stated there are numerous different reasons as to how this can be achieved and why Smart meter functionality would not work. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to hold E.ON Next solely accountable for the issues encountered with the Smart gas meter.” Ha Ha facts are starring them in the face but they choose to ignore, how is that impartial ?To The Energy OmbudsmanPlease don't reply with your standard  spill  “Hello, we're sorry to hear that you have not had a positive experience when using our services. “  as you are not impartial and I wasted more time and effort contacting you in the first place.

United Kingdom,3,1,20-Mar-24,3,1,2024,What a total waste of time and space,"My recent case with the Ombudsman (this is my second) was a complete waste of time. The first was bad enough but was eventually resolved 11 moths but whereas this second case was also found in my favour, the Ombudsman's resolution placed no more demands on the company than had been offered in the deadlock letter and did not require them to actually resolve the issue.The issue was not one of money but of a ludicrous Estimated Annual Consumption. In itself that shouldn't be an issue but this figure is shared around the energy industry and it prevents me getting valis quotes in the event I would want to switch.Although the Licence conditions for supply dictate that the supplier must present an accurate and transparent figure for EAC, the supplier claims they are unable to correct it manually even though it was caused by them inflating the figures for meter reads by a factor of 10. They first of all told me it would correct itself after 6 months of Smart meter reads and when that didn't happen they moved the goalposts and said they needed 12 months reads. It was at this point that I made a formal complaint and they deadlocked it and I involved the Ombudsman.Incidentally the Ombudsman is paid by the Energy Industry itself for each case on which it is asked to decide but it is not actually able to demand that the supplier actually does anything. It cannot therefore be impartial yet at the end of the day we will be paying for it through our bills.Overall my assessment is that the Ombudsman is A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME AND SPACE.Note to Ombudsman - Don't waste your time posting  boiler plate apology here it is meaningless and a total misuse of bandwidth.

They have no power evidently to do anything else!Never answer the questions put to them and just generally ignorant and useless!British Gas also advised that they haven’t been in touch as regularly as claimed and have ended up hopefully sorting this out myself and chasing the ombudsmans conclusion myself as they simply can’t be bothered it seems or can’t do anything if it doesn’t involve emails!!Not fit for purpose as well doing things all by yourself as that’s how it ends up anyway ??,Yes,27-Jun-24,"Hello, we're sorry to hear that you have not had a positive experience when using our services.

United Kingdom,86,2,01-Feb-24,2,1,2024,They began so well but failed to follow-through their Resolution,"They began so well. Gathering evidence, considering and communicating efficiently. The Resolution stage, which found 100% in my favour was great, a £200 penalty payment and an apology from OVO Energy. However, OVO appealed the decision that they should implement a specific performance resolution, without delay. Their appeal was considered and dismissed and the original resolution reasserted. OVO then lied to the Ombudsman saying that all the resolutions had been complied with. This is when the Ombudsman lost interest and in spite of emails and phone calls from me, I have no evidence that they have done anything about OVO's non-compliance.Without explanation, they have left me to sort out what clearly is their responsibility, and I am having time-consuming problems sorting out OVO's duplicity. My new provider is trying hard to sort out the mess.I now doubt the ombudsman's independence from the Energy industry - who are they afraid of offending?Re. Ombudsman's response. My apologies - the email has only just arrived in my inbox. But it really does not say anything meaningful. The Resolution required that OVO act two months ago - they have ignored it and I am still having to sort things out with my new supplier.

United Kingdom,14,1,26-Jan-24,1,1,2024,Deeply Disappointed with the Energy Ombudsman Service,"I recently had an experience with the Energy Ombudsman that compelled me to write this review, and unfortunately, it's a one-star rating from me. From the outset, the service I received was far from what one would expect from a professional dispute resolution body.Firstly, I found the level of engagement and communication to be severely lacking. My inquiries and questions were repeatedly ignored or left unanswered, leaving me in a state of constant uncertainty about the status and progress of my case. This lack of responsiveness not only caused frustration but also made it challenging to trust the process.Moreover, the investigation into my case seemed superficial at best. There was a noticeable reluctance or outright failure to consider all the evidence I provided. Key details and facts that were crucial to my case seemed to be overlooked or disregarded, which was disheartening and frankly, quite baffling. It raised serious questions about the thoroughness and diligence of their investigative process.Additionally, I was alarmed to learn that the Energy Ombudsman is funded by the energy companies themselves. This revelation casts a shadow of doubt over the impartiality and independence of their service. It's hard not to question whether their decisions and actions are truly unbiased when there is such a clear potential conflict of interest.In summary, my experience with the Energy Ombudsman was deeply disappointing. The service I received was not up to the professional standards one would expect from an organization charged with such an important role in consumer rights and dispute resolution. The lack of thorough investigation, poor communication, and questions about their impartiality have left me with a very negative impression. I hope this review serves as a caution to others who might find themselves needing to rely on their services.UPDATE: The ombudsman replied here with ""I can see that our team have been communicating with you regarding your concerns"" but they are not replying to my emails.They are suggesting I take my case to court but at the same time they are refusing to investigate my case even though I have a deadlock letter from EDF.",Yes,07-Feb-24,"Hello Stuart, we're sorry to hear that you haven't had a positive experience when using our services.

United Kingdom,5,1,10-Jan-24,1,1,2024,Ombudsmen do not use. only designed to waste time no justice,"complaint about dwp. And credit card and energy. issue resolved by myself. Not the ombudsmen serviceOmbudsmen is not fit for purpose and designed to time waste and do nothing. Its best to take legal action.waste of time they took 6 months for no reason I suspected it would I used the service 10 years ago in 2024 I thought it would change but no. still the same. they will always side with the other side no matter the evidence and make excuses up. the system and the role of the Ombudsman in any category is to time waste. Only poor people with no money use this service. There will be no justice at all.you’re better off taking legal action and writing to the company your taking legal action if you don’t fix the problem. I just ended up telling the police on the staff member for harassment. and getting solicitors. person was arrested and charged. I will get justice this way and compensation. had same problem with the financial ombudsmen they side with the credit card or gas and electric companies and waste your time. I just took legal action against credit card before it went to small claims court my claim was settled out of court as soon as they got my letter before action.  all my debt was wiped and they paid £10,000 compensation. This was capital one credit card. so, it seems its best to take action yourself instead using this waste of time service Ombudsman should be in jail for fraud and time wasting and wasting public money it’s really designed to time waste and make you think they are helping it’s not, it’s designed not to help you at all. you need to take action yourself and it would be legal action or tell the police depending what your situation it is. we should all get Ombudsman cancelled for good, its really only designed for people who are low on money and cannot afford to take it to court.My circumstances I have no money low on funds how I did it was to look up the law online, and wrote a legal letter before action to credit cards. And gave them warnings. That did it for me. The dwp I just call the police told them I was being harassed, and I record the it. They saw the evidence person was arrested. Before that I complained nothing was done. If I did not call the police, I believe I would be in prison for murder because the person at the dwp was causing me harm and distress and I was ready to attack them. But I ended up calling the police instead. And make sure you record people just encase you need evidence these people are not above the law. And please complain about the ombudsmen they are a waste of time and corrupt its designed only for poor people. which they know they can mess around with. no one with money will use their service when they have the money to take court action.",Yes,23-Jan-24,"Hello, we're sorry that you haven't had a positive experience when using our services.

I’ve phoned 12 times in the last 4 months and been promised a callback from a senior member every single but have never ever received one. Each time I call I’mtold by the advisor  they can see the notes on my account and “don’t know” why nobody has ever called back or responded to my complaint. I was promised a callback most recently when the managers got back after Xmas. Guess what Xmas was 3 weeks ago and still nothing so are they all still on holiday in mid January???  I emailed months ago asking when the formal complaint form on the website will be fixed, no reply.I guess they found a way of getting zero complaints about their service by just removing the form submission , and ignoring emails and not returning calls.If you think you’ll ever get fairness or transparency from this so called “impartial” service then the facts I’ve just stated should show you otherwise.Have also emailed the CEO mvickers who also ignores communications.Nice to know us taxpayers are funding this service only to be made to feel so unimportant that we aren’t even given a response.

The issue was around backbilling by OVO who refused to answer to my requests of only contacting via email - though they were happy to call everyday from their debt collection number of which I didn't answer.  The debt was finally passed/purchased by a DCA who I also didn't correspond with and instead contacted the Ombudsman.  The service is great in that you can upload all your evidence to a case management portal and then discuss this via a phone call with the EA.  The timeframe is I think 6 weeks for a resolution but mine was dealt with before expiry and a credit was issued as an apology to me.  The DCA continued to call for a while but Stephen also got OVO to put a stop to that.  Happy result all round.  Don't be caught out by backbilling, contact the energy provider first via email/post only on their complaints line.  Await for the statutory time to pass and then contact the EO if they are still chasing a non enforceable 'debt' produced by a technical error.  Find on your own energy providers website rules & legality around backbilling and use this link in every email correspondence you send.

I believe it is worth contacting the Energy Ombudsman even with a general query.

They didn't even understand my complaint let alone do anything about it. They reviewed my open and shut case with lots of paper evidence proving the utility provider Octopus had made numerous miscalculations, multiple documented accounts of malpractice and had lied several times on record. The ombudsman didn't acknowledge any of the malpractice I was trying to bring to light and instead concluded I was just trying to dodge a bill. Don't waste your time with them. If you have paper evidence like I did, just lawyer up and do it yourself.Update: They reply here with a platitude-like offer of support within a few days, but in reality when I appealed, they refused to discuss outright or even entertain any notion that they had misunderstood. Even the measure they proposed were to address me ""not being able to pay"" which was not the case: I had offered to pay the supplier many times and they had failed to take payment as agreed. I was trying to report the extensive and revealing malpractice that led to the situation despite my willingness, ability and attempts to pay the supplier.

United Kingdom,1,1,30-Nov-22,11,4,2022,Complete waste of time and sides the…,"-- UPDATE, Following your reply --Evidentiary Concerns: It has come to my attention that certain aspects of the evidentiary process have raised questions regarding fairness. There appears to be a perception that evidence submission and evaluation may not have adhered to consistent standards. Despite presenting evidence demonstrating my lack of culpability, there was a decision to accept a specific call recording. This raises concerns about the application of a dual standard in assessing evidence.Inquiry into Purpose: A fundamental question arises regarding the objective of seeking assistance and support. There is a need for clarification regarding the purpose and scope of the assistance sought, as the grounds for such assistance remain unclear.Handling of Evidence After Deadline: It has been observed that evidence submitted after the established deadline was considered, which seems to be inconsistent with established protocols.Perception of Fairness: There is a prevailing perception that the principles of fairness may not have been equitably applied, particularly in cases where one party bears the financial responsibility for the process.Impact on Trust: The manner in which this matter has been handled has led to a diminished sense of trust. There is a perception of misinformation and a lack of transparency in decision-making, which has further eroded confidence in the process.Challenges to Impartiality: The payment arrangement between the energy supplier and the entity responsible for adjudication raises concerns about potential conflicts of interest and the ability to render impartial decisions.In light of these concerns, there is a need for a thorough reevaluation of the process to ensure equity, transparency, and the restoration of trust in the proceedings.Complete waste of time and sides the energy business1. Lack of Impartiality: It is evident that the energy ombudsman's service lacks impartiality, as a service cannot maintain neutrality when the entity being complained about is financially tied to it.2. Delayed Evidence Submission: The energy supplier was granted a significant extension, spanning over two weeks, to submit their evidence. This extended period provides ample opportunity to manipulate or fabricate evidence while I, on the other hand, adhere to the stipulated deadlines.3. Condescension: The demeanor exhibited by the ombudsman's representatives was notably condescending during the proceedings.4. Ethical Concerns: It is puzzling to comprehend how an organization professing to assist consumers can uphold ethical standards when they blatantly disregard factual information.5. Contract Discrepancy: Although my assertion maintains that my contract was unlawfully acquired, the energy supplier's viewpoint was validated without proper investigation.6. Concealment of Unfair Charges: The ombudsman seems complicit in the energy supplier's practice of concealing unjust charges from consumers. I intend to furnish you with relevant regulatory references and correspondence with Members of Parliament to substantiate this claim.7. Dismissal of Valid Points: While some of my concerns were deemed valid, they were ultimately dismissed without proper consideration or resolution.8. Interpretation of Contract: The ombudsman contends that a call recording constitutes a contract. However, it is crucial to note that, in my view, a contract necessitates the ability to review and comprehend its terms before formal agreement.My overall experience with this process has been distressing and has induced significant anxiety. Regrettably, it appears that the ombudsman's office demonstrated a lack of concern for the emotional toll this ordeal has taken on me. While I have been provided with a decision and the possibility of receiving an apology letter, I must question whether a mere letter of apology is sufficient to rectify the harm caused. To liken this situation to a personal injury – imagine someone inflicting pain, stealing from you, and causing financial distress. In such circumstances, would a letter of apology alone suffice to heal the wounds inflicted?",Yes,18-Sep-23,"Hello Jeremy, we're sorry to hear that you have not had a positive experience when using our services.

United Kingdom,7,1,22-Dec-22,12,4,2022,"Initially incompetent, ultimately lacking empathy","The first investigation was so incompetent subsequent investigations reversed the decision. The investigating officer clearly lacked important, relevant knowledge. He also failed to acknowledge that the energy company sent the deadlock letter informing me of my rights to take my case to the Ombudsman to the wrong address. This didn’t inspire confidence that the investigator read any of the documents I submitted. The final report failed to take into account the “time and trouble” section of the Ombudsman’s own website.  For example: “Is each case treated individually? Yes. We look at complaints on a case-by-case basis and consider the customer’s individual circumstances when considering an award....”My report: “... we must remain consistent with our awards to ensure we are not offering one customer much more than another based on their individual circumstances.”“What is meant by trouble? When we talk about trouble, we mean the distress, disappointment, worry, anxiety or upset caused by how a business has behaved.”“What is meant by time? Time means the inconvenience, hassle or irritation caused to a customer by the actions of a business.”It was clear from the amount of evidence I submitted, the length of time I’d been communicating with the energy company as shown in the detailed notes of my conversations with them (also submitted as evidence totheOmbudsman) that dealing with their bullying and incompetence cost a lot of my time and caused me significant distress.  This was in the context of bereavement and serious health challenges, known both to the energy company and the Ombudsman. Calls were not returned, despite assurances they would be. A known issue on the website stopped me uploading evidence in the way I was meant to. I found comments of one particular staff member heartless and lacking in empathy.

United Kingdom,19,1,31-Oct-22,10,4,2022,Not very impressed at all,"My complaint was never seen by an ombudsman, instead an investigator responded. What is the point of having trained and qualified ombudsman if you cannot access them? I had been treated abysmally by Shell for months and had several serious complaints. After submitting it took ages for the investigator to look at them. They changed the company name several times, and even sent my full complaint to Shell - who advised them not to investigate! The investigator did not act on the vast majority of my complaint. They did not speak to Shell about any of their wrongdoings. They did not pass details onto the Regulator - even though some of Shell’s action were borderline illegal and against their own standards. They did not punish Shell. Whilst the investigator agreed that Shell were completely in the wrong, the only official criticism they made was that Shell gave me an incorrect date for one payment of money due to me. The only sanctions they gave to Shell were a tiny fine and a request for them to write an apology. When Shell did not send the money they were fined within the timeframe I had to go back to the investigator. They replied and said they were not interested as the case had been closed. This is not good enough. As there were no real consequences for Shell given by the investigator following my serious complaints, there is absolutely no reason for Shell to do anything different in the future. They are free to treat customers as badly as they wish. This should not be how the system works. The ombudsman should have seen the complaint, and it is their role to highlight wrongdoing, correct it, and ensure it cannot happen again.

I notified the Case Officer & offered a more accurate (1.4m3) useage, to which I was advised to accept the judgement as I would see the benefit when the 2.16m3 credit was applied.So, as the advice was coming from the Ombudsman - I accepted (conditionally) the Ombudsman judgement. Success: British Gas paid/credited the £75 & the £150 to my account, then relieved it of the amount due because of the Ombudsman determining that BG readings were under estimated.When it came to the Crediting of the 2.16m3 of Gas/day - for the 3-year period, British Gas refused to comply, stating that the Ombudsman was aware?I (again) made contact with the Ombudsman Case Officer, who replied saying that he has questioned British Gas & will get back to me when they reply.Weeks (& weeks) later, I've heard nothing - so, again - I make contact & send a reminder....Eventually, I get a reply from another Case Officer (only Senior this time), stating some sort of cop-out, with a statement that ends....""Your complaint with Ombudsman Services is now closed with all remedies implemented and we will not make further comment on your complaint about further reductions to your account.""So, as you can see, in a nutshell - they have been as much use as a chocolate fireguard..!!Honestly, the amount of time & effort that I have had to put into this, and for what - it seems, to do everyone else's job for them....Yes, I may be bitter, disgruntled and 'chees'ed-off!But, I'm not trying to put you off using the Ombudsman for your own specific reason, I'm just sharing my experience, yours may be a much simpler series of events, with a much more successful resolution.

Despite everything showing clearly and concisely that the supplier was negligent and their customer service has to be the worst I have ever in my life encountered, the fact this company are allowed to physically say ""its ok if you die"" and the Ombudsman services will protect them means you will spend substantial time collating information and forming a complaint for absolutely no accountability to be held. It is a complete waste of time for consumers and they offer no protection to anyone other than suppliers.

United Kingdom,60,1,16-Sep-22,9,3,2022,Completely corrupt,"OVO cancelled my fixed rate gas without my consent and put me on the standard. The Ombudsman did absolutely nothing despite all the evidence I supplied and supported OVO, so now I'm forced to pay a higher rate. I tried to challenge them wanting proof that I personally said I wanted my gas rate changed and they just closed the case. None of my other issues were addressed either so now I'm just left nowhere:When OVO took over SSE, they kept my credit balance and didn't transfer it over.I have missing and inaccurate bills. I eventually got through on the phone to OVO who said I had to call SSE (even though they're the same) to get them sent, which they never did.They are still overestimating my gas usage at around 4 times my actual usage and consistently insist I put up my direct debit to more than double the amount. The Ombudsman did nothing to help me other than offer a £50 gesture for 'a shortfall in customer service'.It is a complete joke. They should be in prison along with the energy companies who are making billions through blackmail. No matter how much I reduce my usage, I can no way reduce the service charges that make up a large part of the bill. Even the government pays the energy companies the grants/subsidies first before they pass them on to you in order to prevent you from cancelling your direct debit. They are all completely corrupt and should be in prison.TO FOLLOW UP TO YOUR REPLY:You completely ignored my evidence and sided with the corrupt behaviour of OVO. Actually, no detailed explanation was provided, and none of my other issues was addressed. You just closed my case and upheld the initial biased outcome. The complaints procedure only covers how I was dealt with by the Ombudsman staff and is therefore completely useless. It does not address bias and corrupt support of corporations. I have ongoing issues and expense that I now have no one I can go to with and I am continuing to experience abuse.I see I am not the only one having issues with your corrupt services due to all the negative feedback here, which, like many of these corrupt corporations, you seem to respond to without delay.

A not fit for purpose service with no real powers to punish companies for their outrageous behaviour. I managed to get them to uphold my complaint that Eon next had not dealt with my complaint properly and kept inflating my monthly direct debits without justification. This resulted in the ombudsman asking Eon next to pay me a £30 good will payment and apology letter which they did. Sadly, the Ombudsman failed to see the clear evidence of Eon over charging me over a period of 2 years and then on changing from Eon to Eon next they falsely carried over a balance that did not exist. They themselves had agreed to refund me but the ombudsman said they couldn’t find this evidence despite providing the date and time of conversation with the eon next. As I say it’s a kick in the teeth to get an apology letter and a £30 goodwill payment when the company owes me £155 in credit. I provided all the information required with dates, times and people spoken to including emails and the ombudsman said they couldn’t verify this information. It was so easy to see what I had paid and what I owed without complicating things.  I have since left Eon next and told them where to go!

United Kingdom,19,1,01-Nov-22,11,4,2022,Be aware they may try to get your review cancelled,"I wrote a critical review previously, explaining that using the Energy Ombudsman was a total waste of time, involving a very substandard investigation and decision.  The appeal “decision” being even less satisfactory.  The Energy Ombudsman asked Trustpilot for further details, purportedly to enable them “to write a useful reply” and to “verify my experience”.  Trustpilot’s email said “Of course, it’s totally up to you what you share.”   I had no wish to share anything nor hear further from them; the investigator(s) having concluded their review of my case and largely ignored what I raised.  If they’d been interested in my concerns, they’d have addressed them properly originally and in the appeal.  Instead their priority appears to be to determine cases quickly. The next day the Energy Ombudsman sought to get my review removed, unless I could verify it.  I sent proof to Trustpilot.  Be aware, they’re not the only organisation on Trustpilot who adopt this unacceptable tactic to try and get negative reviews removed, knowing that a proportion of people won’t reply to Trustpilot.  But as a public body, they should not be doing this. There was nothing whatsoever in my review that would give any grounds to suggest it was fake.  I doubt they ask for proof where people post positive reviews.  And Energy Ombudsman, please don’t bother posting a generic reply to this review.  In reply to my previous post you wrote “Our team take great care in ensuring that all elements of the dispute are addressed and will have provided you with a detailed explanation as to how the decision was reached.”  What you meant to write was your team should do this.

Should you wish to leave further feedback on your experience, then we could encourage you to speak to us directly so that a member of our team can address any concerns. We do advise that consumers continue to make payments towards their energy usage. Whilst we understand that the billing may be wrong, there would still be energy consumed during the billing period and making a payment towards the energy used may prevent debt collection activity. When the bill is rectified, the payments made will still show on the account and will be included in the new bill. This may also help prevent a large bill accruing whilst the issues are resolved.

United Kingdom,42,1,14-Feb-22,2,1,2022,Useless Energy Ombudsman,"Still fighting with British Gas 8 months later. Ombudsman ruled in my favour, awarded £150 ex gratia payment and letter of apology, both went to my old address which is unbelievable, promised it would be resent, still nothing 4 weeks later. Ombudsman is funded by these energy companies and will always accept the lies, deceits and fraud that these companies perpetrate on their customers.Don't waste your time and energy, as they are totally useless and although Citizens advice advise the Ombudsman can take these energy companies to court, apparently that is not true either. Between British Gas and the Energy Ombudsman there is no difference as they are funded by British Gas. No backbone, no power, just another useless Quango body that gets a lot of money from these energy companies to which pays for their chairperson's life of luxury and the staff are pawns in their game. Energy Ombudsman is a willing participant in screwing over the energy companies customers. Lies, deceits and delaying tactics are their game from both the ombudsman & British Gas. When does government step in and use their powers to hold these Ombudsman Services and Energy Tactics, probably never as they get too much tax into their coffers. Ombudsman advises you can log a complaint. Yes, and that would really be a good idea :( considering they cannot be held to task as much as British Gas cannot be held to task.",Yes,10-Oct-22,"Hi Elizabeth, We are sorry that there have been issues with the implementation of the remedy.

However, the main thread of my complaint was in respect of a data protection issue where British Gas does not understand its legal responsibilities. The ombudsman informs me that making a comment on data protection is not within its remit and without making any comment on this, or simply referring British Gas to ICO it has left British Gas thinking it can carry on corrupting my personal data on its account records.",Yes,07-Oct-22,"Hi Rob, We understand your frustration however, we can see that our investigations team member has been communicating with you regarding your concerns and has clarified our position regarding your comments.

I am the one always chasing the implementation of solution that they closed. Very disappointing from SSE and Ombudsman. They have left me tearful and more upset.

After making my complaint the Ombudsman went into great detail about how they had applied the credit about 5 pages of what I already knew but failed to spot they had deducted it in a later statement.Of course I appealed and the new ombudsman agreed that It had been taken back but used Ofgems rule SCL 21BA to say that it should not have been applied anyway.

United Kingdom,2,1,24-Aug-22,8,3,2022,Supplier can say they've implemented solutions when they haven't,"I raised a case to the Ombudsman who issued three resolutions or 'remedies' that must be completed by the energy supplier within a certain timeline. The supplier informed the Ombudsman that the remedies had been implemented a few days before the deadline, so the Ombudsman closed the case. One of the three remedies had been completed, one had been partially completed, and the third was not done at all. I raised this issue to the Ombudsman officer assigned to the case. He essentially told me I'd need to work it all out with the energy supplier or to bring the Ombudsman proof that they hadn't implemented the remedies. After chasing my supplier six times, I finally was able to get documentary evidence and have sent it back to the Ombudsman. But I don't hold out much hope that the Ombudsman will follow through (much less that the supplier will do as they're supposed to) since the Ombudsman closed the case a month ago. I'm not really sure what the point of raising a complaint to the Ombudsman is if they will close it down the second the supplier says they've done something that they clearly haven't. Surely the burden of proof should be on suppliers to demonstrate that they are being truthful rather than making consumers tangle further with a company that's been judged to have done wrong?",Yes,26-Sep-22,"Hello, We are sorry that you are unhappy with your experience when using our services.

And I had to pay 6 months power in advance to get it switched back on, which I did not get refunded when I left that energy company immediately after.

Instead like the bias sheep they are, just accepted that there has been usage and not question how there could be when the flat was unoccupied and almost everything shut off for over 2 years.I was given £100 refund as a ‘good will gesture’.

When you compare energy deals at a comparison website, the price you are quoted will include standing charges for both gas and electricity, as well as the energy itself.""""""

After much hassle I complained to the Ombudsman but the Ombudsman refused to investigate because the incident happened more than 12 months before, despite me having to nurse my dying wife during that 12 month period.I then had to prove Negligence on the part of the North Ayrshire Council, which I did with the help of the Freedom of Information Commissioner, and was offered £30 in compensation with no satisfactory explanation for the one third reduction.  I refused the offer in the time limit set and it was withdrawn.   The case continues after more than 4 years.  She did suggest the option of a Judicial Review but that is much more cumbersome and expensive than a Small Claim in the Sheriff Court.Part of the duties of the Ombudsman is to seek to improve public administration and I asked her to -operate with the Freedom of Information Commissioner to get North Ayrshire Council to remedy the Maladministration that led the Negligence but she refused.   eg1 Recording of complaints. The telephone operator is not allowed to transfer the call to the Roads Department, which is responsible for dealing with potholes, but tries to be helpful by supplying the online Claim form by Email links which do not work. By chance, it was noticed that the Claim form did not download all the information on the form and a second form had to be sent.If a complaint has already been received about the same subject, the system refuses to record any further complaint and states, “Thank you for taking the time to contact us today. As this has already been reported, there is no need to complete the remainder of the form”. If a road engineer, superintendent or inspector issues an order to repair all the potholes in a road and then fails to check and record that the work has been done, the computer corruptly records that the work has been done. The other two Ayrshire Road Authorities do not use this corrupt computer programme. The exact location of the complaint has to be recorded on a map, which is difficult to locate and involves a further visit to the site and delay. Even if no claim is being made, the public should not be discouraged from reporting matters affecting life and limb.2 NegligenceThe Council insists on a claimant proving Negligence even when they know that they cannot cope with a pandemic of potholes in severe weather. Instead of being sympathetic, Paul Doak, Senior Manager, Risk & Insurance Team, refuses to take phone calls, denies negligence and responsibility, ignores previous correspondence, uses semantics to hide requested information and does not fully record the explanation and calculation for the reduction from £45 to £30 for the Time conditioned Offer. The advice of their own Information Officer was ignored in dealing with the request for information.The Senior Insurance Manager falsely claimed that the Statutory annual inspection of the road absolved the Council from Negligence.3 Further MaladministrationOnly 19 of the 417 claims were dealt with during the particular 6 month period.I received an apology for my claim of 26/02/18 being “finalised” on 15/05/18 without telling me and while still the subject of correspondence on 15/08/18.The RMMS Insurance Report does not show all the faults reported. It mentions only one on 29/12/17, two on 03/01/18 and one on 28/03/18, all with different information, eg the one on 29/12/17 states, “Completed – WI not returned from Depot and actual date completed 01/01/9999”Thomas McAulay, Roads and Transportation, on 13/09/18 attempted to justify the procedure for dealing with NAC road repairs and confirmed that a status, “Completed – WI not returned from Depot is automated and signifies that the defect is no longer present even when the original paperwork to repair it has never come back into the office and that you can’t say exactly when It was repaired or by whom” This automated system seems to have a corrupt programme and is not used by the other two roads authorities in Ayrshire.Three contradictory, illegal and wrong reasons were given for the one third reduction in the £30 offer.I shall be pleased if you will exercise your statutory role in improving complaints handling by North Ayrshire Council which is an organisation under your remit.",Yes,20-Apr-22,"Hi Kenny.

United Kingdom,23,1,29-Mar-22,3,1,2022,Avoid. Just go to Court.,"I have been dealing with Ombudsman Services for over 6 months now and I have to tell anyone reading with the resources to take an energy company to Court to skip this process entirely and just go straight to Court.The Ombudsman has been powerless to prevent Scottish Power from committing criminal acts of financial fraud and extortion - the police could not care less. The fact is that Ombudsman Services operate within a sandbox they've been given by OfGem but OfGem have put rules in place that stop energy companies from being held to account by anyone other than themselves and they rarely do anything. In fact OfGem will openly tell you, whilst you are going through hell, that they won't investigate consumer matters.As I say, just go to Court and save yourself the prolonged anguish. Placing my trust in Ombudsman Services has eroded my trust in people/justice/the system/society and I now need weekly therapy to get over the fact that there are untouchable people working for Scottish Power that can do whatever they like and we're all powerless to do anything about it unless we pay money and take them to court.

United Kingdom,18,2,28-Nov-22,11,4,2022,I moved in to a property supplied by…,"I moved in to a property supplied by Utilita, I couldn't top up my gas meter and was kept in emergency credit for weeks, I topped up over £350 in 2 week's and nothing was reaching my meter so I switched supplier and made a complaint to Utilita who took weeks to respond, would hang up the phone on you after waiting hours on hold and one operator breached my personal details and tried hacking into my social media accounts. I know it was from Utilita as I don't use the email address I provided to them! Also Utilita tried to say my electricity meter was 6063kw when I switched supplier when it was only 4280kw, I took photo's as proof. Anyways long story short is Utilita said I was to contact the Ombudsman who ruled in my favour but closed the case before Utilita had remedied everything. I was given a pathetic £60 as a goodwill gesture and an apology letter, but they still haven't sent the correct handover figure to Octopus energy, which means I'm not able to pay my electricity bill and haven't been able to pay since last September when I switched to Octopus, I'm disabled with a chronic illness and this has put me in to financial hardship. Because the Ombudsman has classed the case as closed, Utilita aren't doing anything and neither are the Ombudsman who have told me they would chase up Utilita? I'm not getting any response now and I've had to raise yet another complaint with Utilita. I personally think the Ombudsman service is being lazy and just not bothering to help now as they've closed the case. I only accepted their pittance of an offer as I wanted it resolving quickly. I'm now going to have to see how I can take this matter further as I'm not happy at all with the lack of help and advice. I personally think I should be put back in the financial position I was before Utilitas incompetence caused me such problem's. I've used the Ombudsman service before in the past and it was a complete waste of time and even when they rule in your favour, it's a waste of time.Looks like I will have to take this matter further. I'd appreciate a member of management to contact me ASAP please before I have to escalate matter's further as I want to challenge this case as it is NOT CLOSED!!!",Yes,02-Jun-23,"Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us, we're sorry you have not received all of the actions we specified in resolution to your dispute.

This in my view shows another instance of the contemptuous extent that the EDF executive holds customers in, lowering themselves to vindictive actions such as thisI should have insisted on a much greater compensation amount in this case The visit to my premises was done not by EDF but by an external contractor. The negativity regarding both EDF and the call centre operatives who apparently are not in the UK was coming from this person in heavy wavesFurthermore the call centre operatives seem to work from a narrow script which means when they come upon an unusual problem they are totally lostIt became very apparent during the conversation that although I followed the instructions to install the IHD correctly, it would never have actually installed on the EDF system because EDF had not removed the old IHD in the first place, something they did not disclose to me the customer or indeed you (Ombudsman Services) the investigatorThe contractor removed the old IHD from the system, and then installed a completely new IHD and set it up with the systemHe did this in twenty-six minutes from first knock on the door to packing up to leaveIt is a great pity that EDF could not have sent this engineer round when the problem was first reported in October 2022We would then not have had all the resultant hassle through to May 2023Ombudsman Services is not strong enough it needs a great many more teeth to do a stronger job on behalf of customers against what are for the most part foreign owned companies who treat customers simply as a cash cow with little regard for their needs",Yes,02-Jun-23,"Hi Roy, thank you for taking the time to leave your feedback.

It took several months of misleading responses from them before they advised it was an issue between the DCC and meter. Because of the way in which EON.Next had acted I decided to raise a case with the Ombudsman. It was a complicated process and, whilst EON.Next were persuaded to provide a small level of compensation, the issue was not actually resolved - given that it is purported to be between meter and DCC I would assume multiple devices were affected and that a resolution would be more forthcoming and that the ombudsman could apply pressure.... This appears not to be the case",Yes,10-Feb-23,"Hi John, we are sorry that we were unable to provide you with the outcome that you were hoping for.

Once the complaint was fully registered the process itself was quite straightforwards and the investigating officer was professional, polite and clear in their communications with us. The matter was sorted out once and for all and things have now settled down with the energy company. A couple of things to note if you are planning to make a complain that I wish I knew ahead of time:If you have a rep you will need to confirm to the ombudsman that you are happy for them to act (I didn't know this and it delayed the complaint a couple of months);Make sure you have all your evidence ready for upload when you have the opportunity - the energy company uploaded a LOT of docs to support their points, if I had known about all of these I would have uploaded others as well (and you don't get a 2nd opportunity to add more later on);Ensure you bullet point the issues and are as clear as possible in your description of what it is and where the failing was - this helps the investigating officer to understand your complaint and nearly all our communication was via email/online messaging (personally I prefer a phone call to ensure all points are covered and understood, but appreciate this is not always practical so make sure you have it clearly written down so a third party can follow it!).",Yes,12-Jan-23,"Hello, thank you for taking the time to share your review of our service.

Took it to the ombudsman where Octopus then offered £30 ""goodwill"". Ombudsman review the sale and concluded that the product was mis-sold, the sale wasn't robust and that the document was far from clear and therefore upheld my complaint. But despite agreeing the product was sold the Ombudsman was not interested in putting it right by ensuring the contract was adhered to. Additionally in their decision, the Ombudsman repeatedly suggested that the sale was in ""July 22"" and that because of the fact that wholesale prices had skyrocketed, I was actually better on a variable tariff. Completely missing the point that the sale was in July 2021! Did they correct that error and re-draw their decision though? No. They simply put that down to ""clerical"" error despite it being used to make decisions.

However Scottish Power have failed to implement the recommendations which has been reported to the Ombudsman but despite 2 complaints in March 2021 and again in March 2022, 2 case handlers, 2 remedy letters and a staggering 17 months later I am no closer to resolving my issues with Scottish Power and the Ombudsman appear to be powerless to help me.  To add insult to injury my case is marked as 'Completed' and im not even sure what to do from here??The Ombudsman service need some kind of system to monitor and ensure that companies actually implement the recommendations they agree to before marking cases as 'completed'.  Or even better cases should remain open until recommendations have been actioned. Very disappointed by this service and wouldn't recommend...So just to update you.  Thanks to the person who escalated this through my review, I finally received an email from Scottish Power confirming that my switch had been completed, they requested a final meter reading which I promptly provided.  My new supplier Octopus Energy contacted me the following day to request a meter reading and I thought all had been resolved.

The Ombudsman found overwhelmingly in my favour. However, their order for a “goodwill” payment was ludicrously inadequate. £100 for 6/7 hours of my wasted time over 10 months is very disappointing. I was expecting compensation not some paltry “goodwill” gesture. The CEOs of these huge companies must be laughing up their sleeves at the way the Ombudsman treats them with kid gloves.",Yes,26-Sep-22,"Hi Osman, The aim of Ombudsman services is to put consumers back in the position that they were in before any issues with their provider occurred. We are a dispute resolution service and work differently to how a court would, therefore we do not offer compensatory amounts for time. In instances where our team identify shortfalls in service made by the provider, they may recommend a monetary award for these shortfalls however, this is not a payment for time spent by a consumer, as each consumer values their time at different amounts and it would be unfair to offer consumers differing amounts for complaints of a similar nature.

United Kingdom,5,2,10-Aug-22,8,3,2022,I'd advise against using them,"I'd advise against using them. Despite my case actually being upheld, the Ombudsman failed to incorporate two different government legislation pieces in their consideration aka the Advertising standards agency and Sale of Goods Act. They literally ignored government legislation.  I was more informed than they were (or they expected me to be) and I got the impression they work with big business to try and make complaints go away as easily as possible (EE in my case) rather than being 'independent' and holding big business to account. After weeks and weeks I just got broken and gave up and accepted their pathetic offer to make it all go away. I won my case but truthfully EE won and can continue to screw over consumers with false advertising in the same fashion without any real recourse. I should have taken it to the advertising standards agency, or my own legal route.",Yes,20-Sep-22,"Hello, We are sorry that you are unhappy with the outcome of your complaint.

Which they said they and the company had done before. As soon as I mentioned that sets a precedent for the company being responsible for the debt (due to lack of reminder to apply for disability discount). This offer was then taken off the table/never spoken of again and no resolution was offered.They were lovely and polite.

This can help them to identify customers who may need further support with their accounts. However, certain discount schemes are run through the government and are only administered through the energy supplier and therefore it would be the customers responsibility to ensure that they register for these discounts in time, the supplier would not be responsible for any reminders.We always aim to provide as much support as possible to our customers but our decisions are formulated based on a few different factors including the relevant rules and regulations.

There will be no end to my frustration.I cannot change supplier because no one else will quote. The energy supply market is now effectively dead.In the eight weeks suppliers are given to answer complaints I sent over 40 emails, all unanswered.Why as long as eight weeks?There have been many complaints about Neo Energy, and they have clearly broken the General Conditions of their licence to operate, but the Ombudsman has not seen fit to ask Ofgem to to take any action against them.The Ombudsman has no powers of enforcement and Ofgem refuses to get involved in spite of their stated aim to protect consumers, especially vulnerable ones.They just keep saying ""not within our remit""",Yes,05-May-22,"Hi David, We are sorry that you have not had a positive experience when using our services. When a complaint is raised with us we ask for a summary of the case in order for us to be able to investigate the issues that have occurred. Unfortunately, any further issues that develop after the investigation would need raising with the supplier first as a new dispute. OFGEM guidelines state that suppliers should be allowed 8 weeks to resolve a dispute through their own in house complaints handling procedure before we can consider the dispute - alternatively, a deadlock position may be reached before then if the parties are unable to reach a resolution before the 8 weeks.

United Kingdom,19,3,13-Apr-22,4,2,2022,Okay!!!,"I joined my supplier, Outfox the Market, in July last year and everything was fine. Then they installed a smart meter late last year and horrendous problems since. They estimated one of my bills which was way over exaggerated what my actual usage was so I complained. They were not bothered at all and no acknowledgement of the issues at all. Disgraceful customer service so took them to the energy ombudsman, as if we weren’t in the current climate I would have moved from them by now. The process is easy enough to do but you do have to wait a while before you get a decision but you can appeal it, which I think is good. I understand everyone else’s comments that they don’t really listen or take in to account the reasons for the complaint but I suppose they have to see what went wrong not really judge on what the energy company should or shouldn’t have done. In the end they did agree with the energy company on my main point but I did get compensation for the poor customer service, which I wasn’t offered anything by Outfox the Market so I suppose that helps. I would use the process again but just don’t get your hopes up that you will win as they don’t really work like that.",Yes,20-Apr-22,"Hi Charlie, Thank you for taking the time to leave us your feedback. We do have to look at the dispute from both parties perspectives and not only understand the nature of the complaint but also consider this in line with current regulations and consumer rights. We also have to understand whether the supplier took the necessary steps and followed the appropriate processes to try to resolve the dispute before it reaches us. Unfortunately, there are times when we can only deliver a partial resolution that the consumer is hoping for but we appreciate the time you have taken to leave a balanced review on our service.

The process was simple and the guidance received invaluable.However, there are some very basic steps you need to take BEFORE contacting the OS. For example, 1. You must make a FORMAL complaint against the company and this can be made in either letter, email, online chat or speaking to customer services. 2. Make sure you emphasise it is a formal complaint and ask for a reference number. 3. Note the date you made the complaint as this is important if you decide to go to the OS because you have to have waited 6 weeks for your complaint to have been resolved before going to the OS.4. Keep copies of every piece of documentation you receive/send as this will be your evidence.5. If the company phones you or you phone them then check that they are recording the conversation as this will also be your evidence.6. Comply with any information requests that the company makes, for example a photo of your meter readings, if at all possible, so that you are seen to be helpful, not obstructive.If, after 6 full weeks ( I left my complaint for 8 weeks just to be sure) your complaint is not resolved then use the online OS services.Just remember though, it is not an instantaneous judgement so be patient.",Yes,27-Jan-23,"Hi Philip, Thank you for taking the time to share your experience when using our services.

Basically i received a bill based on estimates in Feb 2022 of over £700... and this was for a residential property. I voiced my concerns to EDF about the accuracy of their current meter which was 22 years old and asked them to change from this meter to a Smart meter. I also asked them to check if the meter was faulty.They changed it to a smart meter without checking the faultiness of existing meter and then they then tried to charge me approx £2000 based on the readings of the old meter. They would not accept it was their fault for not checking the faulty meter before swapping over and the fact that i had specifically asked them to do this - they even had it on recording! After 6 months, EDF were threatening me with bailiffs .This is when i took it to the Ombudsman Services. The OS looked at all the facts (and i had to be precise) - they concluded that since the estimates that EDF had started was back in 2018, EDF had to repay me back 2/3 rds of the money they had received as the new smart meter was only showing a usage of 1/3 consistently over a period of 6 months.",Yes,19-Oct-22,Hi!

I have been trying to resolve this ever since then, SSE was taken over by OVO  and the bill is still over £7000 I asked the  ombudsman to help which they did they said it has been looked into and it was found to be a mistake made by SSE and carried on when OVO took over the account.OVO  agreed that this was a error.The Ombudsman resolved The complaint and the case was closed. I am still according to their accounts in debt of excess of £7000 I have been in touch with OVO since then they referred me to SSE which was very difficult to get hold off eventually a lady at OVO helped me speak to someone at SSE they said this would be resolved within 24 hours That was over two months ago and I have still have the Bill outstanding To be honest any Energy company would see this was a mistake from the offset from the bills as little as £50 or less per month to 7700 the next month I really feel some of these companies do not pay attention to their customers needs I am mostly worried now because this is making me ill and the price of energy is going up and we get £400 to pay our bills but that will not make any difference To me because that will get swallowed up into the debt that should not be there in the first place.

Because a generation 2 meter was fitted, they had to change the electric meter. We had £50 on the meter and the energy supplier said there was no proof of that and i should of taken a photo (they didn't tell me that when they replaced the meter.We seemed to be getting charged a lot for gas and electric (we didn't know if it was due to the energy crisis). I must of phoned the energy supplier 10 to 15 times over a 3 month period and was getting nowhere.I phoned the Ombudsman service and they talked me though the case step by step, the case hander was fantastic and extremely helpful. I submitted evidence and when I got their decision, I realised I should of submitted top up evidence (the breakdown the energy supplier was different to our top ups). I phoned up the Ombudsman service and the case handler was fantastic again, she talked me through what I needed to do.Due to fairness, another case handler looked at it and worked out we was over charged by £396. They instructed the energy supplier to reimburse the £396, to refund the £50 that was still on the meter, a £100 payment for the inconvenience they caused and a written apology.I submitted my evidence but the energy supplier didn't submit any evidence. Because of this, the Ombudsman service had to calculate all the figures. Without the help of the Ombudsman service, I think I'd be still chasing them now.

BG did not set it up on the national grid for it to be working as a smart meter, which meant I had to keep calling to keep my account in check and ignored my queries regards this. Most of my bills were cancelled/ replaced and it was a mess, contradictory bills stating I was in credit to then be cancelled and state I was in debit and that included my electric which is a smart meter so it can’t be wrong as the bill was for the same readings!I chased this for over a year giving regular readings and trying to rectify the issue, only to be fobbed off each time and left in the cold (pardon the pun), literally not keeping the heating on out of fear that the cost will be too substantial and having no trust in BG.

The ombudsman ruled in my favour well over a year ago, since when nothing useful has happened and the problem remains.   SP marked the case as resolved even though it is not.   The energy ombudsman say they cannot mark it as not resolved and are pursuing with SP outside of the normal procedures (are they just fiddling their statistics ? ).   I have had two long periods of no response from the energy ombudsman where they ignored any updates.    In both cases the handler left the service and nobody took over.    One ombudsman told me it is pointless calling SP as they have to wait on the same queue as customers and get through to a frontline support person who cannot help them.  They also stated they have no power to force SP do do anything. I also opened 2 complaints about the energy ombudsman (both looked at by the energy ombudsman -  so pointless).  Guess what - it made no difference. The ombudsman service is in my humble opinion a pointless waste of time.  My suggestion -  Do away with it and set up a truly indépendant service that has some power to force the useless power companies to provide support and who can fine them on individual cases for not resolving issues.",Yes,30-Aug-24,"Hi DAL,Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback on our service.

Each time I did complaint to Energy-Ombudsman I received an apology plus a meager credit named “as goodwill”. My conscience always has questioned me, what about other thousands if not millions of unaware victim-customers who have been ripped off by EDF for so lang. Is it correct if I keep silence? E-O believes that that just have been a technical error and that hasn’t been widespread which I don’t buy that.In my opinion that error only can happen if EDF intentionally ill-programs their accounting software in order to cheat, which in that case that will be a widespread scam.  As EDF claims providing energy to four- million households in UK alone. Therefore, if EDF overcharges every customer just £ 00.25 per bill that generates EDF one-million-pound fraudulent income per month. In my personal case that amount has been between £5 to £10 per bills. So far, I could only share my story with BBC-watchdog, Trustpilot and Ofgem, because I can’t afford hiring a lawyer.

New smart meter readings indicated 3 times less usage than the EDF estimates for the same months.Despite EDF bills showing 3 to 4 times less usage than the estimate for corresponding periods, the Ombudsman concluded that EDF has a sophisticated system and, therefore, must be accurate.I am deeply concerned about the apparent incompetence and insufficient mathematical literacy of the staff, preventing them from making informed decisions.

Unlike most internet customers I had a lot of paper bills so I could easily prove my company had been altering historic bills and over charging me with fake debt, the case should've been simple. I could not communicate with my case handler I was told every week he was probably on holiday. I kept asking to be transferred to someone else or to a manager but it wasn't allowed. They dragged the case on for almost a year even though I'd already been fighting my company for a year and a half previously and this was my second case, with the same unresolved situation. After nagging them to contact me I received a hostile phone call from a girl claiming to be the supervisor, telling me she had spoken to my company and made her decision in one day after I'd been waiting for months for my case handler to do it. She said she was not interested in hearing my side of the case. She attacked me accusing me of taking 'free' energy and not paying for it and then made her decision in their favour. She said it was not her job to check the evidence. I demanded she provide evidence to support her calculations because the company had not bothered even attempting to defend themselves. She then uploaded tables she had created on the computer using doctored data to manipulate the results in the companies favour, without any explanation as to why she was disregarding the 'actual' data available on the paper bills in my evidence. On top of that, when the so-called resolution was completed without my acceptance, the company doctored the previous years bills a second time to over-charge me further and they didn't challenge them. I was told to just bring a third complaint as it's now a 'new' problem. I repeatedly asked to make a complaint about the ombudsman but was just told to 'go on-line' but I couldn't understand how to do it. My energy company subjected me to two years of Hell, they over-charged me hundreds of pounds, I was forced to pay them even more to buy my freedom and the energy ombudsman assisted them. The company has even tried coming after me for more money, with more altered bills even though I've left, as they know no-one will stop anything they do, this is a scam. I had an opportunity to have my case transferred to the EHU but my energy company blocked them from taking my case, as they only wanted the energy ombudsman to handle it. It's pretty obvious why.",Yes,13-Dec-23,"Hi Caroline, we're sorry that you haven't had a positive experience when using our services. We always aim to provide as much support to consumers as possible and we are saddened to hear that you feel this wasn't the case during your dispute with us.

United Kingdom,7,1,09-Oct-23,10,4,2023,Disappointing lack of technical knowledge or Power to effect change,Unfortunately despite having a pleasant case handler. They have no technical knowledge. They didn’t manage to get British Gas to pick up the phone s as nd engage in a conversation about the problem of smart meters being incompatible with Tesla Powerwall 2 and solar PV systems. Resulting in over charging and phantom draw.  British Gas do not have a process where complaints requiring technical expertise and forwarded to technical experts. After six months of trying to get British Gas to recognise and understand the problem I had no option but to escalate the issue to the Ombudsman. Unfortunately the ombudsman have no real power. They couldn’t make BG engage in a conversation about this issue.  They simply found that BG hadn’t handled the complaint appropriately and said I could request they come and investigate a faulty meter! I’d been trying this for six months hence the reason I had escalated the issue to the ombudsman. I eventually gave up. I’ve now moved up octopus energy as nd I am awaiting the installation of a compatible Smart meter.

United Kingdom,13,1,30-Aug-23,8,3,2023,Disheartening Experience with Ombudsman's Lack of Fairness and Independence,"I recently sought assistance from the Ombudsman and was profoundly disappointed by their conduct. The organisation, once reputed for its independence and fairness, has drastically shifted its allegiance. Instead of impartially addressing concerns, they appeared to favor the interests of large energy corporations.Despite my understanding of their decision, it was evident that the Ombudsman's approach lacked the neutrality it once prided itself on. Furthermore, the process seemed coercive, leaving me no choice but to accept their ruling.As a British citizen, I am deeply disheartened by the Ombudsman's apparent alignment with corporate interests over the well-being of individuals. I strongly caution others against wasting their time seeking assistance from an entity that appears to prioritise the needs of corporations over the concerns of citizens.My hope is that this review serves as a warning to others, highlighting the distressing shift in the Ombudsman's practices and their apparent disregard for fairness and independence.",Yes,06-Dec-23,"Hello Amir, we're sorry to hear that you have not had a positive experience when using our services.

The EO rejected my complaint and appeal on the grounds that EDF did not have the capability to do it.

United Kingdom,5,1,29-Jun-23,6,2,2023,They called us liars and we have no redress!,"Our indoor smart monitor stopped working late February and around the same time the electricity meter gained approximately 900 extra kWh which we deny using.  If this didn’t happen overnight then we would have had to have used 37kWh daily for 29 days (based on actual readings), when our average daily usage over about 10 years has been 7/8kWh.  We are two active OAPs and nothing different happened within this period.The Energy Ombudswomen ruled out the possibility of a glitch on the electricity meter so one decided that we must have had a faulty appliance for those 29 days and the other decided it could have been the cold!  How could we have had a faulty appliance without being aware of it, and how did it manage to repair itself – all without our knowledge.  The cold explanation is laughable – February was fairly mild anyway and we are fully gas centrally heated.  Presumably these employees have electrical qualifications to be able to make such profound decisions based on Ofgem rules. Incidentally my husband is an electrical engineer.BG were no better. Staff were aware of the extra units but didn’t query it, they failed to notify us that the smart meter had stopped providing them with readings about a year ago, and the level of unintelligible comments we had to wrestle with during online chats is astounding.  For example – ‘Our focus right now is on back lock casings.’ Did they mean back log cases?? And ‘I apologies for inconvenience you have caused’ to quote just a couple.  According to ‘google’ the CEO at BG was considering ending the use of 3,500 overseas call centre staff in June this year – not before time!  Perhaps they will employ people with a knowledge of the English language who are able to grasp the problem and deal with it satisfactorily.Overall a very stressful and timewasting experience and the worry is that it might happen againUPDATE What is the point of their useless comments which tell us to contact them (but fail to provide a phone number) when we have already been told that the EO decision on appeal is final. It just adds fuel to the fire!  On the other hand if they genuinely want to improve their service and discuss our grievances they can always contact us. They have our email addresses and phone numbers. There needs to be a form of independent audit of their decisions - ie not funded by utility companies.UPDATE OF UPDATESo I followed up with the invitation to contact them as suggested and this is the reply I received from the Energy Ombudsman.'Due to the nature of the details held by this service the individual that responded to your review would not have access to the case or what has been discussed.

After challenging that bill successfully, I was left with a significant credit, as OVO had made a technical error. However, OVO kept saying a technical issue kept them from refunding the money in credit. The Ombudsman did establish that the technical issue was 100% the fault of OVO. However, the Ombudsman, whilst awarding an amount in compensation, directed that it be credited to the same OVO account that they would not refund. The Ombudsman would not put a binding timeframe on when OVO should resolve their technical issue and close the account, even though the Ombudsman said OVO could use an estimate to resolve. In short, my OVO account is now even more in credit but I have no way of getting the money back and there is no timeframe on OVO to resolve or close the account. The whole Ombudsman experience has added to the time waste and frustration. I made my concerns known before the decision was issued and the Ombudsman refused to change it. After the decision, the Ombudsman just kept referring me to decision, saying I agreed to it. Naturally, I haven't heard a word from OVO, despite the ""recommendations"" of the Ombudsman.

The ombudsman decided it was acceptable to award me £370 as a goodwill gesture and failed appointments. It took over a year to have this matter resolved by an ombudsman who claim to be impartial but then failed to hold OVO to account when they were found to at fault.

United Kingdom,2,1,12-Jul-23,7,3,2023,Absolute waste of time and effort,"Absolute waste of time and effort - I spent 8 months trying to get OVO to issue bills for my gas useage. After an additional 6 weeks with the Ombudsman, they 'sided' with me and issued a decision that OVO should issue accurate bills within 28 days.OVO did not do this but sent a letter lying and claiming they had. I raised this with the Ombudsman and was dismissed, evidence not looked at and told the case was closed. I asked in that case to get confirmation that the bills would be honoured and that was that.I was again dismissed and ignored by the Ombudsman.I escalated and a 'coach' took over. Their decision was to allow OVO as much time as they needed to resolve the issue. No consideration of the further shortfalls in service, no attempt to hold OVO to the already BINDING decision, no compensation, just a free pass. OVO used this free pass to issue a bill for £900 (that I have no way of checking the accuracy of) and the Ombudsman has now washed their hands, saying the issue is resolved (hint its NOT), that actually they have no authority to do anything and never did. Best they can suggest is I start the complaints process again....after having already spent the last 11 months going through it....EDITING TO ADD - as of Oct 2023 (the issue started in Dec 2022) OVO is still treating my complaint as 'unresolved', they still havent fixed the issues, obviously I am still treating the issue as unresolved - currently it is only the Ombudsman who insists the issue is resolved and refuses to take any furtehr action....

United Kingdom,3,1,15-Jun-23,6,2,2023,Complete joke,"Complete joke, my energy account was £5k in credit but when I asked for a refund of £4k that they said would be 5-7 days actually took a month. I called them after the 7 working days even though they never stated working days and was told they would need to recalculate it and then refund which took another 3 weeks. This in turn resulted in a missed mortgage payment damaging my credit file. Ombudsman awarded me £250 goodwill gesture paid direct into my account and an apology. Energy company credited my account then took another 2 weeks to pay out direct to me. The ombudsman service never awards what is fair or just and the goodwill gestures only allow the energy companies to do as they please without any fines/compensation that will stop or at least make them think in future. Total waste of time, small claims court would be a better route!!!In response to the ombudsman response - I did contact the ombudsman to explain how the decision was unfair and did not take into account damage to my credit file and the fact it was deemed goodwill not compensation and was told that the ombudsman cannot fine or ask energy companies to pay compensation so the £250 goodwill was the best they can do. As my review states £250 to the energy company as a goodwill gesture is a drop in the ocean and will not deter them from future issues the same. In fact getting them to pay the £250 direct after they ignored the decision and credited my account was just as difficult as getting the refund that the complaint was about!

United Kingdom,2,1,25-Aug-23,8,3,2023,Be prepared to be disapointed,"There seems little point in contacting them as they back the energy company.  I contacted British Gas multiple times over 7 months to complain my meter was not working, had multiple visits from their employees before the meter was replaced, meter readings were taken but they still estimated my usage at zero for 7 months and then presented me with a large bill.  When I questioned why they that not charged me correctly I was advised under legislation they can bill you incorrectly for 12 months then present you with the bill and you have to pay.  When asked what safeguards are in place to prevent this happening again neither British Gas or the Ombudsman have provided a reply they have just willfully ignored my request.  I was accused of not paying the bills I was presented in full and when I provided evidence that I had this was disregarded.  It is a joke British Gas supplied the meter I advised them it was not working, I told them it was not working correctly repeatedly this involved multiple telephone calls that sometimes last over and hour with wait time and being passed around and they chose to do nothing!  I have spent a year trying to get answers being passed around various off shore call centers,  I have tried to get a reply via Social Media and when they stated incorrect information challenging them on it only resulted in them saying that they could no longer help as subject to a complaint and then they ghosted me.  This  behavior has been rewarded by the Ombudsman who have  white washed their complete lack of customer service and lack transparency by trying to justify it by saying I failed to pay a bill in full which was paid in full and I have proved that.

United Kingdom,6,1,22-Mar-23,3,1,2023,Faulty gas meter,"I had a faulty gas meter (which was recording gas units when there was no gas flow through the meter, resulting in phenomenally high bills). I tried for 8 weeks to get British Gas to change the meter and test the old one, and failed. Finally the Ombudsman took over, the meter was changed, sent for testing, I was paid some paltry compensation, and awaited rebilling from Nov 2022, which the Ombudsman had said would happen automatically if the meter was found faulty. But British Gas only rebilled for half the winter months, and still owe me in the region of £500. The Ombudsman said they could not pursue this as it ranked as a new complaint (how so? It was the final stage of the faulty meter complaint!). I was told I had to raise a new complaint with British Gas, and wait another 8 weeks before taking it to the Ombudsman again. British Gas Customer Complaints department are the absolute pits to deal with. This has already taken me 6 months of stress, anxiety, and huge bills for gas I have not used -- and I am rapidly losing the will to live.",Yes,25-Aug-23,"Hi Jenny, we're sorry that you haven't had a positive experience when using our services.

It was during the energy crisis when it was difficult to switch.They were making up our bills, completely miscalculating and overcalculating and ignoring the meter readings we emailed over.They did not set up our account properly either.The Ombudsman took on the case after the complaints got nowhere. They did look into the case and ordered OVO to pay a small amount of compensation. After this we moved to Octopus Energy, however OVO then charged us for the full month even though we had paid our new supplier Octopus for this energy. So the payment of compensation we received from OVO ended up being defunct as they took the final months payment from this!I contacted the Ombudsman about this after OVO did not respond and they said they will look into it...

I've not been able to use my phone since March and was also not compensated for that. I was given £80 for over £500 worth of damage (which I was quoted) and basically told to go f myself.When giving all the evidence, EE provided no evidence whatsoever in terms of the damage that had occurred with my phone. Just a bunch of phone logs because I had to call EE over 30 times! The OS essentially said to me that ""EE did everything correctly by the investigation they conducted as what we have been TOLD"". Well clearly if that was the case my phone wouldn't be damaged BUT IT IS! It's like asking a criminal 'did you commit the crime?' OFC HE WOULD SAY NO! And during the entire call of explaining why they came to such a disproportionate outcome despite all the clear stress it's caused me, they could only praise EE on how well the escalated the complaint which took over 3 months to no will of their own! They didn't consider a single thing I had written for my evidence nor the actual evidence that they can clearly see the day I sent EE my phone THAT IT WAS NOT DAMAGED!To say I was gaslighted is an absolute understatement and I will never waste any precious time of my life on this stupid process.",Yes,17-Aug-23,"Hello, we're sorry to hear that you have not had a positive experience when using our services.

Later claimed that the ombudsman was not able to consider anything to do with Openreach even though it is same ownership as BT. Something appeared very unprofessional and rushed. The ombudsman appeared to have treated internal notes from BT as having been shared with me at the time - yet they weren't. An appeal was blocked by the investigator ruling that a message with extra evidence was not considered a ""response"" , hence time ran out for appeal. Not impressed at all.Edit - Thank you for your response. I have emailed you directly with concerns regarding this.Edit 2. It's now 3 weeks since I emailed details as per the ombudsman's request.

United Kingdom,20,1,31-Jul-23,7,3,2023,Lip service with no real substance,"What a load of rubbish. I had a young woman attempt to deal with something that was clearly more complex than she was able to competently manage. After an abrupt end to EE, 16 years of being a good customer, they indirectly called me a liar on something that was an attempted scam from a homeworker, their system didnt show the interaction and that put me in a position. I am under a CMHT, psychiatrist and medication and because EE's customer services triggered my symptoms I then had my contracts cancelled, leaving me with a 2.5k debt. THEY- EE advised me to approach the Ombudsman, I explained the circumstances of what had happened, I was empowered initially until I spoke to the case handler who was clearly not interested in the case, I had to repeat again and again - eventually she claimed she understood, but only when I was prompted to upload my evidence I then realised that she was only interested in EE's submission, she paid no attention to mine, and then on a call were she claims she had seen no evidence did she then say that termination fees and cancellations were not issues the ombudsman deals with. I had to withdraw my complaint immediately- this woman had clearly spoken to EE to broker an agreement with them. They are meant to be impartial but I dont believe that for second, a lot of the advisors in the ombudsman are ex employees of EE, 02, BT etc, they all know each other, and they probably receive gifts and sub fees etc to grease the way for people like me to be ""put in our place"". Be really careful with the communications ombudsman - not a service I would recommend - the game is rigged before you even speak to any of them there in Warrington. The ombudsman is meant to make things better in that they can reduce toxic feelings and defuse a bad situation, but in this instance the ombudsman has irritated an already sensitive and aggravated set of circumstances. AVOID! A complaint to OFCOM has been made about this ombudsman. If only I had been dealt with properly, with some dignity and just a baseline respect. If you can try and sort the issues out with the company direct, dont let them hide behind the ombudsman like they have with me in this instance. What made me irk, was the sarcasm on the call where there was no help, Im asked if that person can do anything more to help! Or the other sarcastic retort ""Have a nice day!"". The bottom line with this particular ombudsman is that they are NOT impartial, the whole idea of entering into mediation is to get an outcome that is fair to both parties or unfair to both parties - neither party should come out of it with an advantage over the other - that is what a court of law is for! The case workers have read this review and now they sulk, refusing to contact me at all. They have barred my complaint- this is the professionalism you can expect from them, also expect more fairness towards the company that has wronged you - and the fairness you receive will actually be completely unfair. They are not legally trained, yet the decision is legally binding which does not make sense. This ombudsman operates merely for the sake of it. AWFUL!

United Kingdom,2,1,21-Jul-23,7,3,2023,PLEASE THINK VERY CAREFULLY BEFORE ENGAGING WITH THIS SUPINE AND SPINELESS SERVICE,"I sincerely regret having engaged with the Ombudsman Service and strongly urge anyone who has experienced appalling customer service, or indifference, or dismissive behaviour on the part of their Energy Provider (in my case, Scottish Power) to not make the same mistake……as you are very likely (as evidenced by the volume of 1 Star reviews) to have a similar experience at the hands of  the Ombudsman Service, adding to your existing sense of injustice and level of stress.   I also wrongly assumed that the Ombudsman Service may place some emphasis on the rights of the customer and be an advocate for positive change in terms of holding Energy Providers to account….but I could not have been more wrong. On the contrary, the Ombudsman Service appears to revel in fact that they are not ‘the Regulator’, so they have no say in how an Energy Provider conducts its business and cannot require a supplier to implement any changes in its policy or procedures.  They also have no power to insist that the Energy Company even participates in their ‘investigation’.  So, in my case, having refused to record or address a multi-faceted serious complaint (on multiple occasions), Scottish Power also simply ignored the Ombudsman Services request to co-operate or provide any supporting evidence…..aside, that is, from calling to offer, what I considered to be a bribe by way of compensation, ultimately amounting to £150, after some shameful, used car salesman-esque, escalating offer tactics!  Having declined this offer, and chosen to (mistakenly) seek to have Scottish Power held to account for their conduct, I provided extensive documentary evidence and a detailed summary of a chain of events to the Ombudsman Service, relating to the preceding 5-months of appalling customer service.   Whilst the complaint was ultimately upheld by the Ombudsman Service, I was then advised that the only suggested ‘remedy’ to be imposed on Scottish Power was a request to make a £100 goodwill gesture and to issue a letter of apology.  I immediately challenged the substance of the proposed ‘remedy’, as it is effectively ignored all of the policy and procedural failures, and also represented a compensation payment that was less than already offered by Scottish Power.  This clearly irritated the case handler (as I had not disclosed this offer previously) and the call descended into a very defensive, and frankly insulting, exchange….where I was repeatedly reminded that the Ombudsman Service did not impose penalties, fines or compensation payments, but rather recommended goodwill gestures.  I was also incredibly advised to consider that Scottish Power had already had to pay an additional £350 for each case that is referred to the Ombudsman Service.  At this point, I chose to end the call and advised I would be appealing the decision.  The appeal, however, was considered by a nameless individual, who took less that 30 minutes to review months of documentation before simply upholding the original decision…..at which point you are faced with the option of accepting the decision or the case is closed forthwith.  In conclusion, engaging the Ombudsman Service was not only a complete and utter waste of time but, in my opinion, they it showed contempt for the customer and exposed a supine and spineless culture which clearly demonstrates a Stockholm-syndrome type of empathy with the Energy Provider.",Yes,03-Aug-23,"Hi Kevin, we are sorry to hear that you haven't had a positive experience when using our services.

United Kingdom,19,1,10-Jun-23,6,2,2023,A really disappointing experience,"A really disappointing experience. Our issue was that the energy provider had constantly removed customer entered readings and recalculated bills covering price change periods. Our case handler reviewed ONE of the statements we submitted - the one that DID NOT cover a price change. They admitted not reviewing the ones that actually did cover the price changes. Regardless of the outcome I expected them to actually review all the evidence submitted. The energy company did not even bother to submit any evidence or comment on the case. And why should they, when the likely outcome even if the ombudsman decides against them is that they have to issue a standard letter of apology and pay £100 compensation? It's more cost effective for them to do nothing and take the slap on the wrist.Finally, the energy provider have not even implemented the resolution (although they told the Ombudsman they had). We've provided evidence they have not and heard nothing from the Ombudsman for weeks. It's been a colossal waste of time and energy to get zero help.

United Kingdom,2,1,15-Jun-23,6,2,2023,LAURA C - CORRUPT CASE HANDLE WHO BLOCKED COMMUNICATION AND THREW CHILDISH TANTRUM AFTER POINTING OUT HER MISTAKES ON MY CASE!!!,"My entire experience with the ombudsman regarding ongoing billing issues I have had with Virgin Media for almost a year has been absolutely terrible.They only dealt with part of my claim against Virgin Media but even after a manager took over and dealt with the other half, they still didn't resolve the problem. Utterly useless service.What's the point in a regulatory body such as the ombudsman, if;1. They can't resolve the problem, which is well within their capacity to do so, but they just choose not to?2. They don't hold broadband/telecommunication companies accountable for the way they treat their customers?I am completely perplexed by the treatment by the original case handler, Laura, who refused to communicate with me any further after I allegedly ""offended her"" when merely pointing out that she hadn't done her job properly.For context, Laura C had narrowly dealt with only one aspect of my claim, in particular a line of credit that needed to be added to my account, choosing to completely ignore the fact I had spent upwards of 30 hours on the phone to Virgin Media, I had been lied to by VM managers (I had call recordings supporting this) and the fact I was still being bill substantially more than I should have.When I pointed this out to her, instead of remaining professional and admitting there had been a mistake, which I would have very reasonably considered, she instead divulged into a completely unprofessional rant of how it was ""unacceptable"" for me to point out she hadn't done her job properly and that by definition I was being ""abusive and insulting""?! and would therefore not be responding to me any further.What then prevailed was Laura's manager, Peter S calling me to combatively argue the points ""You can't tell Laura how to feel"" and ""Laura's feelings have been hurt, so she won't be dealing with your case any longer"" - What kind of organisation is the ombudsman running here?!What an utterly ridiculous situation to evolve from an already stressful situation. The ombudsman has quite literally flipped the lid on me, a member of the general pubic who has been genuinely stressed out of their mind trying to get this situation resolved, and in-turn positioned themselves as victims of non-existent abuse in an attempt to fabricate an excuse whereby they have the authority to close off my case and basically sit at their desk doing nothing.Government-funded organisations do not get to dictate to the general public whether or not they will assist them based upon perceived offence, especially where mistakes have been made on their part and this has quite rightfully been pointed out. In doing so the ombudsman falls foul of unlawfully promoting an environment in which freedom of speech is violated.If an employee has not done their job properly then the ombudsman needs to consider this fact and conduct an investigation, they should not be encouraging employees like Laura C to throw a tantrum and refuse to work simply because one of their mistakes has been pointed out, not that by doing so I meant any malicious intent. For the employee to then make wild and unfounded accusations against members of the public in an attempt to justify their unprofessional and uncontrollable outburst warrants escalation, and in my mind reporting to the Government.What the ombudsman may want to consider asking themselves in future is;1. What happens when all employees get offended in the course of their job?2. Do they all then just refuse to deal with the general public i.e. refuse to do their jobs?3. Is the ombudsman going to continue employing people who carry this entitlement mentality?Doesn't seem particularly feasible or economical for any business, but then again we only have to consider the fact that the ombudsman in funded by the very organisations it purportedly fights against.Offence is going to occur in any part of society whether intended or not, it is unavoidable, so stop policing speech and expecting people to walk on eggshells for the benefit of a few individuals who clearly can't cope with the reality of life.This should not have become such a personal or emotionally fuelled situation, especially from the point of view of the ombudsman. I remained perfectly professional throughout the case, not that I had any responsibility to do so, so why is it perfectly acceptable for ombudsman clerks who DO have that responsibility to act in this manner?Terrible excuse for an organisation - AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!UPDATE: The ombudsman have tried to get Trustpilot to remove my review because I included names. Multiple other reviews here have names included so why are those not being removed as well? - A prime example of the ombudsman yet again throwing a tantrum because their conduct has now been exposed!!!",Yes,10-Jul-23,"Hello, we're sorry that you haven't had a positive experience when using our services.

United Kingdom,21,1,03-May-23,5,2,2023,Absolute waste of time,"Year 2021:After months of negotiations with EDF who kept fobbing me off I was left with no option but to turn to the Ombudsman. They have been an absolute waste of time. Despite winning my case against EDF to sort out getting Smart Meter readings they are refusing to do it. The Ombudsman aren't enforcing them. Totally pointless and a waste of energy and time. Upon trying to set up the account on their website when I found that the smart meter data wasn't appearing on my account it is stating no account exists. This has gone on nearly 12 Months now. After contacting EDF end to report that they hadn't set up an account to in like they fobbed me off. I could prove the lack of existence of the account. I went back to the ombudsman and they weren't interested. Unfortunately you can't escalate any issues further even though I have evidence that the agreement hasn't been completed and EDF haven't complied with the instructions. If nothing further is done then I intend to take further steps because it is in the public interest to escalate and expose both EDF and Ombudsman Services.Response to the reply:For the avoidance of doubt I am NOT called @Marion! I did re-contact the ombudsman and was told to go away hence this review. I even enquired whether and how I could escalate the issue to get EDF to be held to account but was told it isn't possible which I found strange considering the previous advice I was given. I was told that they would contact me within 24 hours to explain why. I'm still awaiting that telephone call. I never signed or agreed to a contract with EDF. OFGEM transferred me to them when my energy company collapsed. I would have chosen to enter a contract with my electricity supplier E.On for simplicity. Therefore I'm going to issue my lawful right to enforce ""No Implied Right of Access"". There is no need for them to be given access because they entered a contract to take meter readings over-the-air. The meter was tested and confirmed as transmitting at my end to the DCC network. EDF have failed to set up an account at their end and I have proved it. It is up to them now to take readings over the air. I have complied with my side of the contract. This review has been written ""In The Public Interest"" as a last resort.I have followed procedure, been polite and the ombudsmen have failed in their duty therefore I have been left with no option but to enforce my legal obligations.Update: We are now in Nov 2023 and EDF have STILL not sorted out my smart meter. They even had the nerve to suggest charging me for a IHD that has never worked. It's not just me either. There's more and more people complaining about it and nobody is being held to account.",Yes,07-Jul-23,"Hello Marion, we're sorry to hear that you have not had a positive experience when using our services.

United Kingdom,6,1,09-May-23,5,2,2023,Ombudsman impartial?,"Where do I start. Firstly we got awarded 10k for miss sold gas contract. The broker didn’t even bother submitting evidence as the broker new they were in the wrong. As when I was submitting the evidence I mentioned I have a call recording confirming the rate and what was written on the quotation document, submitted all evidence and everything about the previous case, the outcome, the calls, emails you name it. Everything was the truth.Fast forward now, they use the word OTOR, meaning they should have not taken this case on as the complaint was first made before they started the new scheme for micro business.To fix this problem, the broker and ombudsman agreed on reducing the standing charge and unit rate, however, the gas supplier has not confirmed this with them. As usual the broker changed their mind and now offering a different price to what the initial agreement was. To add insult to injuries, the ombudsman states the complaint would not have been upheld against the company if they had known the first complaint against the supplier with the evidence shown would probably be a different outcome. Doesn’t sound impartial to me. Would avoid them as they do not see consumer side of the story. The mistake is by them and the broker and now they are asking us to agree with the broker even though the offer is different, ombudsman stated this While the contract offer has come directly from the supplier , it is as a result of the work broker has done with them to resolve your complaint. Then states this This is not resulting from any complaint findings or actions required by Ombudsman Services of either supplier or the broker  To confirm, our involvement in this complaint has ended. We are writing to the broker as well to ensure both you and the broker are aware of this position. After this another message from the ombudsman again stating While the contract offer has come directly from the supplier m, it is as a result of the work of the broker, has done with them to resolve your complaint.As previously stated Ombudsman Services original decision in regards to your case does not stand and should be disregarded as the case has been closed as Outside our terms of reference.

United Kingdom,1,1,01-Apr-23,4,2,2023,Don’t bother - They have no power.,"Don’t bother. The ombudsman service is not a compensatory service. My energy provider made an error in my billing which meant that I had been under billed for months, despite pestering them constantly and asking if I have been billed correctly. They reassured me I was managing my account excellently, but when I came to leave, my final bill was hundreds of pounds. I called them multiple times, requested bills, and spent hours making complaints. When I went to the ombudsman, the whole process was investigated, but because I technically owed the amount, not only did I still have to pay it (many people would not be able to pay a lump sum they otherwise would have put money away for monthly), but my compensation as a gesture of good will was £150, which equated to barely any of the hours I put into the process and certainly hardly touched the final bill. My provider faced no other repercussions and will likely make the same error with someone else again. The ombudsman told me they could do nothing more unless I appealed against them… which is ironic. And to this day I’m not sure that they did investigate my bills properly. Truly a waste of time. I may as well have paid up straight away and just never used that provider again.",Yes,19-Jun-23,"Hi Jack, we're sorry that you haven't had a positive experience when using our service.

It was about a case of back billing, where BG had not read my meter for 8 years and there is a law saying that they can only bill you for the last year.  I did not cause this situation on purpose whatsoever, but ended up paying most of the high bill and never understood how it was calculated.  The bills are issued in a way that even if educated, it is hard to follow.  I very much suspect that the EOmbudsman is not entirely unbiased, as the bill was clearly wrongly calculated and they did nothing.  So do not waste your time unlike other Ombudsman services where I have had very good experiences, I think there is too much profit at stage, BG for instance has made billions of profit in the last year and who has got so much money, will finally have the power.

United Kingdom,5,1,15-May-23,5,2,2023,Energy Ombudsman is not fit for purpose,"Let me make clear, this is not a rant because the Energy Ombudsman (EO) rejected my complaint.In fact the EO found in my favour against E.ON Next in January 2023 on six counts. And that is when the problems began.The EO investigating officer who found in my favour then disappeared never to be heard of again. My complaint was that E.ON was blocking the transfer of my electricity account to Octopus. The new investigating officer then repeatedly granted E.ON further delays based on what was easily proved to be misinformation. Just a few examples, E.ON claimed to have made a goodwill payment which they hadn't, they claimed my meter was more than year old, which it wasn't, they claimed one remedy had been implemented when it hadn't, etc etc. All this deliberate misinformation was accepted by the EO without question and further delays nodded through. This resulted in the account transfer being delayed for five more months.Finally I complained to the EO independent complaints department about lack of partiality. First I heard nothing, then I was told my complaint had been 'lost'. Finally I was told the complaint had been passed to the very EO personnel I had complained about, and they had buried it. In desperation I turned to the EO's independent assessor. Hardly surprisingly, the independent assessor found in my favour and awarded compensation, and I received an apology. Suddenly all the insoluble barriers to my account transfer that had been in place for more than a year vanished in days, and the account moved to Octopus .Based on my experience the Energy Ombudsman is not fit for purpose, and other reviews indicate my experience is not unique. The EO's uncomfortably close relationship with the energy companies and its lack of clear accountability means it does little more than tick the self-regulation box.",Yes,02-Jun-23,Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us.

We moved house, asked BT 'home move service' to get us connected to broadband etc and they simply didn't. Without going into too much detail, BT tried to cut corners and not contact OpenReach to send out an engineer (probably to save money), and simply kept lying to us, telling us we'd 'be connected tomorrow' or often that we 'were connected already' when obviously we weren't. This went on for weeks and I kept asking BT for an engineer and was constantly told that I didn't understand and that an engineer wasn't needed these days. Anyway, eventually an engineer came out and the house wasn't actually connected to any cabinet in the street, and when I stood up for myself complaining to BT, they shut me down and forced me to go to the Ombudsman, so I did, uploaded evidence, texts etc and STILL they found in BT's favour, condoning their lying behaviour. An absolute waste of time, do not bother using the Ombudsman, they are a joke of a regulatory body.EDIT AFTER YOUR REPLY:See? You’re at it AGAIN!!! I NEVER complained about Openreach! You seem hell bent on using them as an excuse, it’s BT who are the problem. And of course I never received a detailed explanation of anything, don’t suppose you want to send it? Your services are useless, you know it and your reply only further adds to the proof. Complete joke.As further evidence of your awful service, when your team still didn't reply with any explanation, I called and found out the guy who dealt with me and decided to rule in BT's favour (and never reply again), had left your company!!

United Kingdom,5,1,16-Jan-23,1,1,2023,"Simply put they are ""Not Fit For…","Simply put they are ""Not Fit For Purpose"". In Brief my complaint to them was against Scottish Power. Moving into a new property (14/03/2022) received letter from SSE/OVO informing us that they were the electricity suppliers for the property OK. We arranged to set up a DD for payments, however as they wanted it set at £485 per month we cancelled the DD, took actual meter readings monthly and paid accordingly i.e. electrricity/standing (averaging £140/m) All fine then come September 2022 we start getting demands from Scottish Power for £1945.00 addressed to Owner/occupier. Tried to speak to them on the phone, they refused to discuss it as we were not the named person/s on the account. Scottish Power then continued to bombard us with texts, emails and letters culminating in them sending debt collectors to the house. The person from the debt collectors lookded through the evidence and informed Scottish Power we were not responsible for the amount they were seeking. She did inform us that according to the MPAN and meter serial number Scottish Power were the suppliers of electricity not SSE/OVO who we were paying. We lodged a complaint with Scottish Power, an email from them admitted they were wrong but did not deal with the complaint. End of the matter.......No. Scottish Power then continued to send demands and again referred the account to another firm of debt collectors and having admitted we were not responsible gave this second firm our personal details (clear breach of data protection). That firm then again bombarded us with threatening text messages for a month only desisting after two letters from us (they ignored the first one) and the threat of court action. We served Scottish Power an SAR (subject access request) which they ignored, further wriiten complaints, again ignored. Case taken to the Ombudsman who found that Scottish Power were only guilty of a shortfall in service and should pay the sum of £150 as a goodwill gesture, no mention of harassment or data protection! As the main complaint from us was the harassment issue we appealed, yes you guessed it original decision upheld with the caveat ""they are not here to punish the supplier, the amount of £150.00 was in line with other findings of a similar nature.""

United Kingdom,1,1,04-May-23,5,2,2023,Powerless and Ineffective for the Customer,"In Feb 2023 I went to the Ombudsman to resolve a problem with a Gas Meter in my 84 year old Mother's house.  The meter has not read for 18 months and estimates have been provided by E-On based on a previous over-estimate by British Gas. Repeated calls and visits by E-On Engineers had failed to replace the Gas Meter, snagging suspected ""corroded pipes"" and saying it is not their job or they are not qualified Gas Engineers.  Cadent and British Gas Homecare inspected the pipes and said they were fine to use.  I had complained to E-On about their appalling customer service, which they admitted and they promised to replace the meter and give £80 compensation.  Despite repeated calls and e-mails nothing actually happened, so I thought the Energy Ombudsman would be the people with the power to sort this out.  I spent many hours summarising the case and providing evidence to the Ombudsman, including that E-On are probably breaking the Gas Act 1986 for not maintaining the meter, and their resolution was to tell E-On to increase the compensation by a huge £20, change the meter and apologise! As a result a visit from an E-On engineer in May 2023 resulted in them not replacing the Gas Meter as there was a suspect ""corroded pipe"" of course and the engineer was not even a Gas qualified engineer!  In my conversation with the Ombudsman reviewer it was revealed that they cannot issue punitive fines, they cannot comment on law, they don't pass individual cases to OfGem (so they disappear in effect) and they actually have no teeth whatsoever to change the behaviour of energy suppliers - no wonder the energy suppliers encourage people to go to the Ombudsman, happy in the knowledge that they have nothing to fear and it gets the customer off their back!

United Kingdom,8,1,25-Apr-23,4,2,2023,They don’t enforce their rulings.,"First contacted the Ombudsman in Nov 2021 as my switch from British Gas to Scottish Power was disastrous. (Electricity switched in April ‘21, but the Gas switch didn’t complete. Neither company ever contacted me to say there was a problem and I tried repeatedly chasing the switch with both companies, but both blamed each other and neither could give me a reason why it didn’t go through). Ombudsman seemed fantastic at first. Quickly ruled that it was SP’s responsibility to switch me and that I should be refunded the difference in cost between what my bills should have been with them and what I was actually paying on the price cap with BG (this was before the energy crisis). Also ruled I should be given £50 compensation and a written apology. I received the apology and £50 credit, but still wasn’t switched or refunded my overpayments. I’ve repeatedly contacted SP and been ignored, so have reported back to the Ombudsman many times, but still nothing gets done. The contract should have finished Nov ‘22, so I paid way too much for gas for a whole 12 months.

Together with Eon they have decided i must send an image of my meter. For Christ sake do you not listen, Eon do not communicate. My account has an option to leave a reading but it will not allow this either. Even so, why should I have to do the legwork for a state of the art new smart meter. I wish i had just kept the old meter it was less hassle. Eon or the connected Ombudsman have offered me absolutely no explanation as to why my meter has not been registered and i doubt the problem will be ever sorted out. Why else would i be asked for an image of a smart meter they fitted?

The case handler seems to not understand what 'fair' means.Utterly useless bunch.This initial review prompted an apology; the wrong report had been added to my file. A further review changed nothing. The Ombudsman only reviews whether BT broke its contract; not whether the contarct was fundamentally unfair, which it is - and thus in breach of Ofcom's expectations that it should be fair.

Should you wish to escalate your dispute further then you are still free to pursue a legal route and this can be done regardless of whether you chose to accept our decision.

United Kingdom,13,1,21-Jan-23,1,1,2023,Needs An Overhaul,"From my experience Ombudsman Services (OS) definitions of its payments 'financial award' 'compensation' and 'goodwill payment' need an overhaul, as does the service. 'Compensation' they say is awarded only for complete service loss (e.g. no broadband) elsewhere they say that it is given for issues with customer service. In some documentation they say a 'financial award' is given for 'shortfalls in customer service' in another document they say that a 'financial award' constitutes a 'goodwill' payment for any other issue apart from customer service. My own complaint was accepted over the issue of the 'level of customer service' but I was 'awarded' a 'goodwill' payment.OS website is clumsily designed and communications with me were full of spelling, grammatical and procedural errors and they logged issues that I hadn't even complained about. The caseworker refused to acknowledge his errors and points missed and ignored my concerns. He also ignored service issues that are contrary to Ofcom's 'General Conditions of Entitlement'. There were long delays with my appeal blamed on errors in 'the system' and no apology was given for the many months I had waited for a review of its decision.All OS did was to agree that the original meagre offer (or 'goodwill' payment!) by the power company was sufficient for my considerable inconvenience. Therefore Ombudsman Services fail to provide the sort of remedy and closure that, I surmise, the public want and has debatable influence on improving bad services.My humble advice to those intending to approach Ombudsman Services are to not expect much in the way of justice. Guard your mental health and be assured that you have raised the issue with Ombudsman Services; it's another negative rating of the company in question. And leave a review with Trustpilot of course. Good luck.Update: The organisation protested over my truthful review and wanted it taken down!

We apparently owe nearly £5000. And we cannot put another case forward. Unless new evidence. Wouldn’t matter anyway. Our evidence shows that Eon were fully at fault and didn’t cover their legal responsibilities. But we got an “I’m sorry” letter, £30 and a bill in the thousands. Eon bought  Npower and it has hugely impacted their profits. Why not drain a couple of octogenarians for their pension to make up the gap, and send a sorry letter!Just an update following the response/reply I have just seen from the ombudsman. Has anyone else noticed how the responses don’t deal with issues, they are platitudes of words that don’t add anything. Templates of responses, picked at random, when the last contact on the decision is that their decision is final, take it or leave it (not exact words, but the gist is that). I wonder what the true meaning of ‘we’d be happy to help’ would be? Do you think they would revisit the result and overturn the verdict?

United Kingdom,10,2,15-Dec-23,12,4,2023,Ghosted by the ombudsman,"The energy ombudsman was initially very attentive when dealing with my complaint and was quick to provide a resolution, even if the energy company failed to respond to the ombudsman's decisions. However, when problems with the energy company (Scottish Power) persisted 6, even 12 months after the case was marked as closed, neither Scottish Power nor the ombudsman would respond to me.  Scottish Power failed to take over my energy supply within a reasonable timescale and did not communicate with me in any way to resolve this, Scottish Power failed to link my accounts to a dual fuel tariff (a decision that was binding and one that Scottish Power were contractually liable for) and this issue persisted for 9 months after the ombudsman claimed to have resolved the complaint, and Scottish Power then placed a billing block on my account due to incorrect readings imposed by their system, 12 months after the complaint was 'resolved'. During this time Scottish Power refused to communicate with me directly and required I 'go back to the ombudsman'. When I returned  to the ombudsman, she ignored me, leaving me completely helpless with neither party willing to communicate with me to resolve the issue. Initially, I was advised that it was escalated with the executive resolutions team however I was met with radio silence each time I chased up resolutions with the ombudsman due to Scottish Power's refusal to deal with me directly and no such communications from the executive resolutions team.  I have made a decision to terminate my contract with Scottish Power as a result of this and I am thoroughly disappointed in the ombudsman's lack of response when I have repeatedly reiterated that the issues are not resolved and Scottish Power will not resolve them with me without mediation through the ombudsman. This is negligent and leaves the consumer helpless and contradicts their website which states 'If, after allowing 14 days, you believe that the resolution has not been completed, please contact us back and we will look into this for you'.",Yes,16-Jan-24,"Hello, we're sorry that you haven't had a positive experience when using our services.

United Kingdom,7,3,01-Dec-23,12,4,2023,"A sticking plaster, not a cure","I had a FIT account with SSE, which was transferred to OVO Energy when the latter took over the former a year and half ago. From that point on my FIT payments stopped. Countless calls and emails over the course of the next year failed to resolve the issue, so I finally contacted the Ombudsman. Registering is pretty straightforward and the responses were impressively fast (a welcome contrast to my experience with OVO). Eram, the case officer was conscientious and kept me in the loop at every stage of the process. I felt the compensation of £60 payment proposed was inadequate for the year  of stress I'd been through, and after  deliberation, this was increased to £175. So, a 4 part remedy was proposed which included payment of the more than £2500 the company owed me, as well as the compensation figure. In addition, there was a clause to address the underlying issue, which appeared to be that OVO had somehow failed to properly register my account. OVO appealed, claiming they couldn't pay the outstanding sum within the one month specified by the Resolution proposal! Apparently, because of the appeal, the case was passed on from Eram to a 'Coach', who then contacted me to say she was minded to accept the appeal. When asked on what grounds the appeal was based she said she didn't know! Our subsequent discussion clearly indicated to me that she hadn't read any of the details of the case. At my insistence, she agreed to contact OVO and find out why they couldn't pay and when they proposed to settle. The reply was that they needed two months apparently, (after over a year!) to which, now just wanting a settlement, I agreed. Well before the 2 months had expired, the coach contacted me again to say she was going to close the case. This was because OVO had made a submission claiming they had settled all aspects of the claim. They hadn't - part of the sum owed was still outstanding - and so the coach reluctantly agreed to keep the case open. In addition, OVO claimed that the underlying problem of my account not being properly registered had been dealt with, but I still couldn't see a way of submitting meter readings, other than by email - which hadn't resulted in any payment in over a year! (To get a resolution, Eram had had to submit readings on my behalf!) I pointed this out to the Coach, who insisted that all aspects of the case would have been addressed once all payments had been made. The final payment was made - 1 day after the 2 months deadline - and the case closed. So, I have received all the payments owing up to September this year, but because there is no evidence that the registration issue has been dealt with (other than OVO saying it has),  fully expect that I will need to go through the complaints procedure with the Ombudsman all over again! So 3 stars for the fact that the Ombudsman service resulted in my being paid the sums owed for the past year, but at the same time, failing to address the underlying issue. Had this review been based solely on the work of the initial case officer, Eram, I would have given 5 stars, but the coach, who took over, clearly just wanting to get the case closed as quickly as possible, showed no interest in achieving a lasting resolution.",Yes,02-Jan-24,"Hello Martin, we're sorry to hear that you have not had a positive experience when using our services.

With this in mind, it is difficult to understand what their purpose is. And do not confuse the term 'independant' (which they claim to be) with 'impartial'. There is a clear distinction between these terms.

My eyesight is not very good and i cant read the online version on my smartphone screen very well so i wanted a paper copy of this bill to take to CAB to check i wasnt being overcharged.This ombudsman service failed to ensure british gas provided this paper bill. When i complained as to why this had not been addressed, the case handler said if they could read the online version so it didnt matter! I pointed out that they were viewing the bill on a large computer monitor, and i dont have access to a printer, they merely claimed it is not their responsibility to make british gas provide a readable version of the bill. I couldnt believe it. A woefully ineffective service that appears to casually discriminate based upon physical ability and socioeconomic factors. Very poor.

United Kingdom,11,2,24-Nov-23,11,4,2023,Poor convoluted internal processes designed to put off customers contacting them,"To escalate a complaint to Energy Ombudsman you have to :1. Have a computer and access to the internet.2. Be computer savvy and learn how to register for an online account, navigate through their links and also be able to download emails , letters and communications with the energy company  in certain file formats. For instance , I found out that scanned jpeg type docs are invalid. 3. I had to continually email them all the emails/docs to do the downloads onto my online account for me.4. Even after providing all the emails/letters /docs  and waiting for the 8 week deadline  you have to spend hours completing an online summary of the history of events, contact names , emails /letters sent , etc . They give the energy companies 8 weeks to do nothing , except maybe start work to resolve the issues on the day before deadline date (especially when it's an issue where the energy company owe the customer money).Then at the end of the whole process and after hours completing their online forms, they have a little 'pop up' message saying that if it was an issue regarding a deceased account holder, to please provide a 'Grant Of Probate'  or 'Letter Of Administration'. My father died a few months ago and they are requesting a 'Grant Of Probate' (which can take 3-18 months!!!!).  My father had a credit balance with So Energy before he died and they owed £500 to his estate. So Energy wouldn't provide a final bill , repay the credit ,  close the account , transfer the supply to my sister under a new account and raise backdated bills for her to pay. They gave me and my family the run-around since 25th Sept , requesting the same documents (fathers death certificate, wills , my mothers death certificate from 4 years ago, proof of my id , my bank details, etc,etc) while not doing anything with them. You'd wait a few weeks, send another email and someone else would ask for the documents again. You'd send emails to So Energy CEO and they would also ignore them. 5. Anyhow , after I completed the online forms, my case was forwarded to a handler , who messaged me via my online account saying that she would be going on holiday for a week (Great!).6. Then I get a message from her that she requires me to send a ""Letter Of Undertaking', confirming that I am not pursuing this issue for personal gain"".  Okay , so spent more wasted time drafting a letter , signing and scanning it for download onto my online account (but got message saying download failed, invalid doc type).7. I  edited the 'Letter Of Undertaking' to also make a complaint about the convoluted internal processes they have implemented that seem to put obstacles in place to dissuade customers from using their services. I emailed the letter to my case handler and cc'd it to the Ombudsman CEO Mr Matt Vickers.I have told them that I want my case resolved next week and that I will be contacting my MP with the history of events.In a nutshell , the energy ombudsman service is not fit for purpose except for customers who have computers and are able to spend many hours battling through their internal processes/procedures.",Yes,01-Nov-23,"Hello, thank you for taking the time to share your experience of using our services.

I have spent 43 hours on phone/emails etc & it's taken 11 months to date getting one of these meters removed. The Ombudsman became involved at month 8 & was instrumental in pushing this forward in a very real way. But, when the energy company told them that they had completed their side of the agreement the case was closed. Unfortunately, they lied & as at 22/11/23 costs are still being accrued by this account for a meter which was removed in June. The reason for contacting the Ombudsman in the first place was because the energy company was not trustworthy. Why would they believe them without consulting me!My folks are still receiving demands to get a smart meter (they already have one on the correct account) & set up a direct debit.

Lucy clearly understood my complaint and the SSE/OVO malarkey. Thanks LucyHowever, after the Ombudsman decision of July 2023 in my favour, SSE/OVO astonishingly started to send me many emails going back to the beginning as if I was to blame, I owed them money and threatened debt recovery against me.I ignored responding to any of the emails. telephoned SSE/OVO reminding them that they are in breach of the Ombudsman decision and that I would be happy to see them in court. Bring It OnI was told by SSE/OVO that cheques are in the post to me, but they could not tell me what the cheque numbers were!SSE/OVO could not make a bank transfer. WHY NOT?!SSE/OVO then used an old, old delaying ploy...The cheques arrived inconveniently on the Late August Bank Holiday weekend and I banked them in September 2023.I have since been contacted by SSE/OVO with their new energy rates...applicable to me...no longer their customer.This from a 'professional' energy supplier.

I had queried this and asked for a meter reader to be sent down urgently, as I have poor eyesight and cannot read the meter properly, as it is digital, and has 4 different settings. The ombudsman resolutions were to my satisfaction. To send a meter reader round, send a letter of apology for the energy company giving me false information, and to set up a temporary meter to check for faults in the current meter. Octopus stated these jobs were complete, and the Ombudman took their word for it and closed the case, without me confirming whether Octopus had completed the tasks set or not. I'm now being told by Octopus that i would be charged £80 on top of the 5K plus they say i owe (despite always paying my energy bills) for the checks on the meter. I have no money, use very little electricity, and use far less than i used before my daughter and husband passed away last year, and my other daughter moved abroad, yet am being charged almost 10 x the amount we were paying as a family. But despite contacting the Ombudsman again regarding this matter, I'm yet to have a reply. I honestly can't deal with much more of this stress. It is far from solved. Only after contacting Octopus again, approximately a week after the case was closed, asking when the meter reader would arrive (now booked for October) and when the meter would be checked for faults, and only then did i get the reply about the charge for checking the meter for faults.I'm already at rock bottom following my losses.

United Kingdom,10,2,06-Jul-23,7,3,2023,Confirmed resolution was NOT resolved at all,"I contacted Ombudsman Services about a complaint I had with SSE/ OVO. My complaint related to an aborted smart meter installation by SSE in Dec 2021 (because of a potential asbestos issue which they were to resolve) and also subsequent threats I had received from SSE about how my power supply would be adversely affected if I do not have a smart meter installed. Before I contacted the Ombudsman, SSE had been taken over by OVO and although I'd communicated several times with both energy companies, neither SSE nor OVO had responded to any of my requests to have this resolved. Initially the Ombudsman service appeared to have more success than I had, having at least managed to contact the energy provider OVO and have them agree to have the work carried out. During all this, I had made it clear to both the Ombudsman and to OVO that it was likely that the next attempt would be similarly aborted suggesting, quite strongly, that the asbestos issue be resolved beforehand. This, however, was ignored and OVO sent the SAME SSE engineer as before and, unsurprisingly, he would not replace the meter. All this was despite that OVO had advised that SSE and OVO are two separate entities and would send their own engineer this time. Asbestos issues just don't go away, which OVO appears to have hoped.The Ombudsman then happily emailed me a few days after the second aborted attempt to fit a smart meter (and also noted on my account with them) that OVO ""has confirmed that it has now completed the resolution actions in full"". I therefore ( 6 July) sent a message via my Ombudsman account to point out that the smart meter issue had NOT been resolved, pointing out the reasons. I then messaged them again on 22 July. I have not had any response to date. It appears that the Ombudsman thought that OVO's voluntary and quite paltry £100 compensation was all that I was after, which is of course was not the reason at all.Initially the Ombudsman appeared to have carried out quite a lot of work on the case and all appeared to be moving ahead as I'd hoped (hence giving two, not one star). Sadly their arrogance in dismissing my request for a proper asbestos inspection and resolution, prior to the second meter installation attempt, means that we have all wasted our time. Finally, as the company I had complained about had been extremely unreliable, hence my complaint and, at best, had been economic with the truth, why not ask the 'complainant' whether or not the resolutions had been put in place? As expected, I have received nothing since from OVO regarding any of this, other than a similar 'how did we do?' survey, which I answered with much of the same as above. They clearly take no notice of these anyway.",Yes,28-Jul-23,"Hi David, we're sorry to hear that you haven't had a positive experience when using our services.

I have knocked one star off for the amount of the compensation awarded to me which in respect of the appalling service I had to endure from the awfulness which is Ovo - every time I received a letter from Ovo I telephoned them which on EVERY occasion (until the person who was assigned to me agreed there was no point in responding) was a completely fruitless exercise and wasted about an hour of my precious time and yet Ovo NEVER complied with my repeated 'Subject Access Requests' which I was told was their legal requirement and I wonder how Ovo gets away with this behaviour.,Yes,24-Jul-23,"Hi Claire, we're sorry that you weren't completely satisfied with the remedies that were provided in resolution to your dispute.

This further encourages energy companies to over estimate usage in order to improve their cash flow.

United Kingdom,4,2,04-Jul-23,7,3,2023,Beware of using Energy Ombudsman Services,I have always paid energy  bills by direct debit and when I changed provider from British Gas to Bulb I gave  both companies my meter readings.Approx 12 months later I moved  house. Then out of the blue a debt recovery agency contact me on behalf of British Gas saying they made an admin error and I owed the £600 and I hadn't responded to their letters. I explained I had moved  house over a year previously and my mail redirection serhad stopped several months ago.Naturally I contested this  bill but having spoken  to call handlers and complaints departments for several  months I couldn't get any real explanation from British Gas other than they admitted they made an error in my billing despite the fact I pro idea correct meter readings.I used the Ombudsman service and my story is familiar to others on Trustpilot.I  was offered £100 goodwill payment because of British Gerrors but told to pay £500 because of incorrect billing over two years previously.Ombudsman service  cannot make an award for compensation for my time and effort in trying to resolve this episode.If I was paid minimum wage for the hours this has taken me to resolve British Gas would owe me money and this isn't an exaggeration.Ombudsman services explained they cannot award compensation for my time and effort which in my view makes them a toothless tiger.The multinational energy companies like British Gas who will make over £3bn profit this year are allowed to ride roughshod over small customers.So was I  satisfied with the Ombudsman Service  the short answer is no because they don't have  sufficient powers,Yes,13-Jul-23,"Hi Mr Beecham, we're sorry that you are not completely satisfied with the outcome of your dispute.

The contacting of the company seemed worthwhile. The resolutions accepted & even suggested by the company seem extensive & a good result for the complainant. The fact that it appears once suggested , there seems to be a concept of ""well, that's that"". Despite the carrying out ( or lack thereof) of the resolution/ suggestions or the watering down seems unmonitored & leaves the complainant feeling it was a slight waste of energy & effort. In my case for example there was a request for compensation - agreed by the company . A request for a written letter of apology - agreed by the company- A request for the app. to be made to work- agreed by the company. & Supplying of an IHD (as required within 1 year of a new customer joining apparently, by legislation) - agreed by the company. There has been a completion email sent to yourselves by the company, at which it appears this has been taken at face value. As it stands, at this point - the compensation is yet to materialise. The IHD apparently won't be delivered  - citing availability problems. An additional suggestion by the company of a meter change to alleviate problems has been quietly shelved since offer from company ,acceptance by me , & informing yourselves it's been done. It now no longer is mentioned at all in communication from the company. The  written letter of apology agreed to,  is a line that contains the word sorry in a general email about the company regarding its commitment to customer service & a contact details of a person at the company known as the ombudsman specialist resolution advisor.  The app. does seem to work, at this stage. That is possibly more of a by product of the company needing it to function for myself & other clients sadly tethered to it by mandatory updates without consultation. I'm back at the feeling slightly  powerless stage due to what feels like a nodding , then nose snubbing by the company at a gullible ombudsman. I know there's a better way to structure that & formulate a better expression, but I'm out of energy for that now. That being said , this could just be how Ovo/ Boost operates & by the 16 th of May 2023 ..all matters will have been addressed. Fingers crossed. - Albei I'm not sure crossing fingers is the correct way to run any form of resolution process. I hope this makes sense.

Some aspects of the complaint were upheld and a goodwill payment ordered. However one aspect, which was excessive demands for increased direct debits was not upheld due to the Ombudsman only being able to assess the payment demands against current energy prices when the complaint dated back to February 2022, 2 price rises ago.

The complaint resolution entails that the energy company SSE provides me with an apology and to make a payment of £200 as a gesture of goodwill. This outcome does not reflect the considerable distress, inconvenience and wasted time my wife and I went through over a sustained period with impact felt over a year, which was demonstrated by the collection and organisation of substantial evidence showing mismanagement and poor customer service of the SSE, which wrongly pursued us through debt collection agencies to settle a gas bill that we are not liable for. We were issued numerous incorrect revised bills, on occasions warning of legal action if payment is not made.There is no opportunity to disagree with the Ombudsman decision as it is based on a ‘take it or leave it’ approach. The appeal procedure only allowed in special circumstances e.g. if new evidence becomes available after the complaint was submitted.",Yes,02-Mar-23,"Hi Luay, we are sorry that you are unhappy with the outcome of your dispute.

United Kingdom,27,5,14-Sep-23,9,3,2023,Scottish Power Electricity Overcharge and billing issues,"I was on the Scottish Power Green Fixed Evening May 2023 Tarrif. When this tarrif was coming to an end, I was overcharged on one of my electricity bills. After this all electricity bills stopped and I was just paying for gas. I made many fruitless calls to the direct debit call centre who decided that my smart meter was ""running backwards""and arranged a replacement of my smart meters.  Thats just stupid I thought but I went with it.  Needless to say the replacement meter worked exactly the same as the old one.  I raised a complaint with SP and was told every couple of weeks or so that SP were still dealing.  However, no one in the company's billing team(s) would take ownership and resolve their billing problems.  After the 8 week period SP called me and said they could not resolve anything, not even give me a refund for the overcharge. So I raised a case with the Energy Ombudsman.  What a difference that made. Jake, the case handler, kept me fully informed, was very polite and very helpful. Jake got Scottish Power to give me a goodwill payment and gave them the list of issues I had raised.  After the normal time allowance given to energy companies to resolve complaints, SP had done nothing apart from give me the goodwill payment. Jake did his investigations and found in my favour on all points I had raised and told SP to get on with it.  About a week later, SP called me and said all of my issues had been resolved.  I checked and agreed. Without the Ombudsman I would still be chasing SP with my list of complaints.

From the moment our dispute was taken up by the Ombudsman, OVO/Boost was galvanised into action and the pressure on them was not lifted until they (finally) implemented all agreed resolutions. All communication with us from the Ombudsman was prompt, intelligent and precise, unlike that which we received from OVO/Boost, whose incompetence is breathtaking: they took 18 months to send out two men who took two hours to commission a meter. I spent many fruitless hours writing letters to OVO/Boost and trying to phone them. We then involved our MP who could not get anywhere either, and who suggested the Energy Ombudsman. We are very grateful that this Ombudsman service is available, and is free, and that OVO/Boost respects the Ombudsman’s powers enough to actually sort things out. The only problem I had with the Energy Ombudsman was with their website when I started to upload my evidence online. There was so much evidence that I couldn’t add it all at once. I would like to have been able to build it up over several sessions, as I can do with my tax return, and to edit it before final submission, but this is not (yet) possible. Fortunately, the Ombudsman was helpful again, and was able to upload my evidence after I had emailed it to our Investigating Officer.I brought this case on behalf of an elderly and vulnerable friend, and we are both hugely grateful to the Energy Ombudsman for being there and for helping us.",Yes,24-Nov-23,"Hi Valerie, we're happy that we were able to help you and your friend reach a positive outcome to the dispute.

The agent acting on our behalf put all our ""evidence"" together in a document highlighting the failures of SoEnergy. SoEnergy had to make good all the recommendations of the document and make (paltry) financial compensations which went to our SoEnergy account. I recommend the Energy Ombudsman.

I sold a property in 2022 and have been receiving demands and threats of court action and debt collection agencies for 11 months. All this over an estimated amount! Steven Hartley from the Energy Ombudsman was brilliant even when I broke down in tears of frustration because myself and the new owner have tried fruitlessly to resolve the issue with OVO. It’s easy to use the Ombudsman Service online. Be prepared to upload documents of proof. 4 hours after the call from the Ombudsman service I had a grovelling call from OVO with an apology and a compensation offer. It’s very reassuring to have an Ombudsman Service when these big organisations get it totally wrong and just don’t listen to the customer or communicate information between departments. The completion statement from my Solicitor for the sale just wasn’t picked up even though they asked me to send it 10 months ago.,Yes,01-Nov-23,"Hi Carole, thank you for taking the time to share your experience of using our services.

We had invoices showing that EDF owed us money amounting to £298.00. I chased this money (why wouldn't I). Fast forward to 2023, four times I had been lied to regarding the refund 'your cheque is in the post', 'it has been returned and we are issuing a new one', 'I have been told it is out for signing', Finally 'I have seen it on the desk to be sent out in todays post'. Did it ever arrive 'NO' it did not,I received a telephone call apologising for the non refund, but could I send in the readings right from the begging of this problem, EDF already had them!!Next I knew was that the £298.00 refund had turned into a £975.00 debt The Energy Ombudsman was then brought in another two months down the line and still at stalemate. We keep getting threatened with Legal action this is being sent via a solicitor that we used and has nothing to do with EDF, EDF also filed against my wife as a DEBTOR!!! EDF really are using Bully Boy tactics.I have to say that I wrote this review two days ago, since then there have been developments.I thought that the Energy Ombudsman had given up my fight!But today, I here from the energy ombudsman, that they had been sent some more invoicing from EDF and low and behold EDF do indeed owe us £295.30p. I knew EDF were hiding something.So very well done The Energy Ombudsman Team.",Yes,10-Nov-23,"Hello, we're sorry that you haven't had a positive experience when using our services.

But after numerous attempt to correct the reading and they admitting they would do that they never did. And kept raising the bills and they refused in the end our reading they kept telling they were right and so Ombudsman took the case and British Gas even appealed against their decision but a month later and the case was solved. I received an apology letter from British Gas with the compensation Ombudsman set and the final bill corrected so I was able to pay them the correct amount that I have been asking from BG for 6 months!If you provide all the evidence on your portal to back up your case no doubt Ombudsman will do all they have in their power to get the case solved for both parties.

Our opinion of Shell Energy is of course unprintable.

Jake Hampson was excellent and helped me enormously as I am not great with technology. I hope that the issue has been resolved but had a slight hiccup this month, but I was told that I may contact them again should the problem occur again (after the appropriate  8 week grace period) which is a comfort to me as I have no one to help me.

The Ombudsman confirmed British Gas should be able to function to this level.At this point I decided to try and get a final resolution with British Gas myself.As a retired person I did have the luxury of going out and enjoying myself or using all my time to try and get British Gas to do their job properly.I chose the later and spent many days, (maximum length of time on one phonecall 2hr and 5mins) speaking to nameless call handlers who clearly had no understanding of why British Gas was not doing its job correctly.After another dozen fruitless calls and failed promises from British Gas I telephoned the Ombudsman service. I had concerns because it was a London number and living up north it is not where I easily communicate.However the call handler put me through to Mr Chris Bush. I explained my wish to get British Gas to deal with me and my account. Chris took all my information over the phone and said he would be taking up my case against British Gas. After some further discussion I said I would post evidence to the Ombudsman due tomy difficulty with technology. Chris could not have been more professional or supportive. I could also read everything on email which Chris had confirmed all my comments. I had already told British Gas what I required to bring my complaint to a resolution.To my surprise I could see Chris had told British Gas he was dealing with my complaint on day (1) when I spoke to him. Again another surprise, On day (3) I got a phone call from someone at British Gas wanting to resolve my complaint. This person was using their brain and offered the resolution I had asked for, plus money as an apology, alongside their written apology.The Ombudsman through Chris Bush checked with me continuously until the agreement had been actioned.I received an email yesterday checking if the agreement was still holding.I had clearly failed to achieve this result on my own and I'm most impressed with the Ombudsman Service and with Chris Bush the Case handler that dealt with my complaint.",Yes,09-Oct-23,"Hello Ray, we're glad to hear that you had a positive experience when using our services and that our team supported you throughout the dispute process.

United Kingdom,38,5,27-Sep-23,9,3,2023,Succeeded where I could not.,"Without the support of my Energy Ombudsman case handler, I would still be struggling with British Gas and the debt collectors sent after me for money that I did not owe.  I had been with British Gas for over twenty years, but moved house just at the time when they were migrating my account to a new computer system and I fell into a chasm.  They simply could not grasp that I had moved house, and so wouldn't refund my large credit balance.  They never answered the phone and the queues for Web Chat were so long that you were timed out of your account.  If I did get through on Web Chat, I was assured that it would be sorted but nothing ever happened.  Online complaints were given a reference number and then ignored. My bank had to block British Gas's repeated attempts to reinstate my direct debits with them.  The final straw was when I was harassed by debt collectors who had traced me to my new house, chasing payment for the energy supplied to my old house since I had moved.  This was a couple of weeks after my mother died and they wouldn't even listen to my solicitor who tried to intervene.  It was hard work uploading all the evidence of months of struggle to the Energy Ombudsman, but totally worth it.  My case handler grasped every detail and found completely in my favour.  It took several more months, and they treated her with contempt as well, but my account with British Gas is finally closed, and they accept that I sold that house last November.  I have received my refunds, plus £150 by way of apology, the debt collectors have been called off and my credit report is unaffected.  I do not believe that any of this would have happened without the support of the Energy Ombudsman.

An easy one I suspect for the ombudsman but it was a relatively straightforward process to follow.

The Ombudsman’s communication was clear and concise, and their dedication to securing justice for consumers like myself was evident throughout.In short, the Energy Ombudsman has done an outstanding job in resolving my issue, saving me from a significant financial ruin. For anyone struggling with an uncooperative energy supplier, I wholeheartedly recommend them.Thank you Energy Ombudsman for the excellent service.",Yes,18-May-23,"You are more than welcome, Nick!

United Kingdom,17,5,03-Apr-23,4,2,2023,First time using them. Great decision,"I used them for the first time this year. I found it to be a great experience. It took only about 2 months from start to finish and the case worker was lovely... Uploading the information to them was a bit daunting I'd say. Because I'd had so much correspondence from my energy company I was complaining about, and when filling out the form on the Ombudsman site you have to remember dates and conversations and every time there was an interaction.... But it was worth it.... Anyway, long story short.. ish... I got a good outcome and they found my energy company at fault and had to make it right, which they have.. So I would say, don't be bullied by any company, which they tried with me.. . Take it further and get the resolution you deserve..",Yes,18-May-23,"Fantastic news, April.

Eon Next billed me whilst my gas meter had a blank screen for 2021 usage whilst I'd made a considerable effort to reduce my gas due to the energy crisis. The Ombudsman opened my case, informed me every step of the way with updates through email. I was optimistic about the outcome and didn't think the case would be resolved in my favour. It was easy to upload evidence and most of mine were screenshots as I didn't have a lot. The decision was detailed and I felt as if it had been dealt with thoroughly. I am very happy with the result and glad I decided to use this free service. I have since left Eon Next as lost all trust in them. Hopefully will never need The Ombudsman Service again.

I suspect that my correspondents were sitting in India.Eventually I went to the Ombudsman and EDF immediately settled and refunded the money. I was disappointed that the Ombudsman never commented on EDF’s efforts to keep our money and merely said that they had acted properly in charging us correctly against readings.

United Kingdom,18,5,14-Apr-23,4,2,2023,The Switch Agent rules must be changed,"It is obvious that a great deal of work was put into the investigation of our lengthy and second complaint but I have one difficulty with the findings. We found too late that the Power Supplier switch agents who introduced the current supplier include in their small print the right to continue to represent a customer at the completion of the contract they originally introduce but to do so without any reference to the customer by themselves or by the supply company. In our case the switch agent contracted for further supply at the end of the one they originally introduced but this time without themselves or the new supplier (which in this case was the same supplier) informing us (the customer) that such a contract existed or its details, so we had no opportunity to question or approve the deal they had agreed.  We only found out when we asked another switch agent to find a new suppler and they were blocked by the current supplier.  We still do not know what the terms of that deal were, and despite their lengthy investigation neither do Ofgen.  With the current huge rise in electricity charges, it may well be that the secret contract would have saved us a great deal of money.  We eventually argued successfully to be allowed to switch but the secret contract is still secret.  As the customer if forced to use these agencies rather than negotiate terms of contract direct, the law/rules in this respect must be changed.",Yes,20-Apr-23,"Hi Ian, Thank you for taking the time to share your experience of using our services.

United Kingdom,1,5,15-Mar-23,3,1,2023,The Ombudsman were my Knight in Shining Armour!,"I was having trouble with EON for over 12 months. EON were engaging in some dodgy business practises; backdating billing so I was in over £3000 debt, they insisted I paid £300-£400 a month towards the debt alone. I spent many hours over a year trying to arrange affordable payments, pleading that they allow me to pay some amount towards the debt over time. They adamantly refused but continued to harass me with daily phone calls, voicemails, emails, etc. it even got to the point where I was having to relay my financial situation to an EON representative on a weekly basis… as a result, I got in touch with the Ombudsman. I couldn’t have had a better experience; the lady was empathetic and understanding, she took my evidence and took the whole issue off of my shoulders within a couple of phone calls. The result was fantastic - my debt was reduced to 1/2 because EON had broken the back billing rule, I am now able to make the affordable monthly payments, I’ve not heard a dickybird off EON since the decision, other than to remind me about an upcoming bill, they also had to apologise and offer small compensation. Without the Ombudsman service I would still be in a daily battle with EON, I’d still have a huge and unfair debt over my head and I’d still have to endure the humiliating process of explaining my finances to eon, as if they were the HMRC. Thank goodness we have advocates like this that we can turn to, energy companies are becoming ridiculously aggressive these days and without the Ombudsman, I know many more people would be suffering as a result of the bullying practises.",Yes,17-Apr-23,"Hello, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your experience of using our services.

SO Energy had to adjust my account by almost £1000 in my favour :-) Shame that the Ombudsman doesn't have the authority to award any compensation - it took hours of calls and emails to SO Energy to try and get it resolved then quite a bit of time to compile my case with the Ombudsman - SO offered £100 but, I'd sooner they hadn't made the error in the first place!

United Kingdom,10,5,09-Mar-23,3,1,2023,A VICTORY FOR THE CONSUMER,"At last an independent organisation was prepared to review dispassionately and logically the unfounded accusations of debt due for electricity consumed (no workings and no 'from' 'to' dates, by the way) sent by post to me in summer 2022; and review the clumsy attempt to charge me twice in mid-autumn 2022 for the same month's consumption and standing charge. [By the way it seems you have to pay any erroneous bill in full these days, otherwise like on credit card statements etc. you get landed with a Missed Payment Charge; a ""heads the electricity supplier wins, tails the domestic customer loses"" situation, THEN only after paying do you contact the supplier and try challenging their appalling billing system].  Also, you cannot start a case with the Ombudsman {Energy} until the electricity provider has failed to reply to you for a certain number of weeks.  It was a bit laborious to fill in the Om.Serv initial on-line case history and - take note - what remedy/ remedies I sought.  However I was lucky; I kept scrupulous paper records of everything in my battle with the electricity supplier over more than 7 months; dates, times, name of customer contact centre person [huh, contact centre - what a joke] and even the last two telephone calls with that 'contact centre' on a personal digital voice recorder - which I transcribed, I had got so angry by the end.  It takes around 3 months for the Om.Serv to issue a decision.  I won.  The other side didn't even contest the Om.Serv`s decision.   If you have full and unbroken paper records, then you too could stand a chance of winning.",Yes,05-Apr-23,"Hi Keith, we are glad we were able to help you achieve a positive outcome to your dispute.

As expected, nothing but intransigence from BT throughout so we went to the Ombudsman. You can read about our story in the Telegraph - just Google ""BT ignored Ombudsman"".To be fair to the Ombudsman, they did find in our favour. Now, how much of this was to do with our fastidious record keeping (of every email and communication ever sent to / received from BT) rather than their investigative powers is unclear. I will give them the benefit of the doubt by giving them 2 stars.Why 2 stars?Firstly - their actual judgement. Even though they found in our favour, their actual remedy was just for BT to calculate what they had stolen from us and then to pay it back. BT was then able to drag it's heels for months. If the Ombudsman had simply said that BT had breached contract (which it had) and so should pay back everything it had charged so far (and then perhaps bill us retrospectively for the correct amount), we would perhaps have gotten our money back a lot faster.The second issue was this - even after the Ombudsman ruling in our favour, BT didn't pay up! BT then kept lying to the Ombudsman by saying they had complied with the remedies required even though they hadn't! This went on for almost two months and every time we went back to the Ombudsman, all they would say is ""we will send another email reminder to BT - it's all we can do"". This literally went on for two months.They are completely powerless to enforce their decisions and the companies they regulate know it.In the end, it was only Jessica Gorst-Williams from the Telegraph who was able to get our money back.A watchdog with no teeth. Having read the posts below, I was not aware that the Ombudsman is funded by the companies it regulates. Now that I know this, I would say that this is actually the lesser of two evils - if it was us (the tax-payers) funding them, it would be an even bigger disgrace.Finally - after all the above - BT are still breaching the terms of the contract (related to the actual terms of the contract) so we are left with no choice but to sue them in SCC.",No,01-Jan-00,,-43001
United Kingdom,21,2,30-Aug-17,8,3,2017,Ineffective Ombudsman Services: Energy,"I have had a dispute on-going against British Gas since 2011 – and it is still not resolved. In my opinion switching energy supplier to get a better deal should in theory benefit the consumer – however, in my single experience it has cost me nothing but grief and a claim for almost £2000 from BG. From now on I will, like the majority of the country, find a company I am reasonably satisfied with and stay. I engaged the Ombudsman Services: Energy several years into the dispute and they have proved to be totally ineffective. I was appointed an investigating officer, and she got the story, understood my issues, agreed with them and put forward a resolution which was acceptable to me, as it demonstrated I was correct. However BG objected and the investigating officers’ resolution was over-turned and she was replaced. I was then appointed a series of 3 different investigating officers 2 disappeared off the scene when they realised I wouldn’t just roll-over and accept the BG case. The third and final sent out a resolution, which I immediately rejected and he went ahead and told BG the case was resolved. This was a blatant misrepresentation of the truth.The response I got from the 3rd officer was a several page letter which was clearly built from a template as it contained sentences which had nothing to do with my case – my complaint is simply around billing and direct debits; he stated in his resolution that he had considered the information provided including photographs of the dish and proposed resolutions! – bizarre. Clearly I responded and that is the last I heard until BG sent me a letter saying the case was now resolved. I phoned the Ombudsman service only to be told that the actual Ombudsman had made a decision and that was that. No further action. The other fact I find amazing is that one cannot speak to the Ombudsman – they do not communicate with the general public, they have investigating officers to do that. My experience over the past 2 years is that the investigating officers just do not or will not try to understand the issues from a consumer’s perspective. It is, from what I perceive, easier to offer the consumer a token gesture in the hope that the complaint can be closed. I suspect they are targeted with closing cases rather than finding the correct resolution, and that the suppliers have a budget to cover such token payments. Next actions for me are to involve the CAB and prepare to take legal action against BG and also to write to my local MP and, if I can find a way of contacting the secretary of state for energy, I will share my experience and reservations around switching energy supplier – no doubt a fruitless task, another bureaucratic position which the public cannot reach out to.",No,01-Jan-00,,-42975

Despite this the Energy Ombudsman suggested the energy company pay back just £250 compensation, a 'back billing' rule was applied in my case, but the energy company have not fully adhered to this.  So I had to file a second complaint to the Energy Ombudsman,  who looked at my case, but despite the fact I have Citizen Advice as my witness and evidence to prove the energy company are ignoring all forms of communication to resolve the issue, they  have failed to conduct a proper and fair investigation, even though I had provided all the contact details of my witnesses at CAB, Energy Ombudsman didn't bother to contact them, they were not interested in the truth, instead they only asked the energy company for their version of events, who obviously told a pack of lies, claiming they haven't ignored correspondence from CAB or myself, (which I can prove otherwise).  I felt like Energy Ombudsman were completely biased, siding with the energy company, failing to protect vulnerable families.Don't waste your time contacting the Energy Ombudsman, if they do on a rare occasion find the energy company at fault, they don't punish them with huge fines, or even clear the complainant's huge debt caused by the energy company's incompetence.EDIT - Energy Ombudsman told Trustpilot I had to remove the name of the Dispute Resolution Executive who handled my case, it appears that it is ok to name a Energy Ombudsman employee if it is a good review, but not if it is a bad review.  How has this Energy Ombudsman employee in question even attained the job role of Dispute Resolution Executive?

United Kingdom,9,1,22-Dec-23,12,4,2023,Can Trust Pilot be relied upon,"Members of the public should be warned!! There is now  further evidence that Trustpilot cannot be trusted to show adverse reviews about the Energy Ombudsman. TRUSTPILOT HAS BREACHED ITS OWN INTERGITY RULES. The Ombudsman in collusion with Trustpilot is using a number of tactics for removing adverse reviews, one method is for the Ombudsman to claim the review is bogus, secondly it is having adverse reviews removed on the basis that they contain named people within the Ombudsman Organisation.  Readers will however note that the names of all staff mentioned in favourable reviews remain  on the review site. Is this not indisputable proof of collusion between Trustpilot and the Energy Ombudsman?In the following review you will note that I have removed the names of the persons concerned. Removal of the names however makes no difference to the review.  The message is loud and clear: Do not rely on this review site and the Ombudsman is paid for by the Energy Companies, therefore you cannot expect an unbiased result.In November I placed a genuine adverse review about the Energy Ombudsman. Despite providing the Ombudsmans case number, Trustpilot have removed my review.My complaint about the Ombudsman was that due to the Ombudsmans failure to complete the complaint process about the failure of OVO energy to provide Bills, I was subsequently visited by debt collectors and had unjustified charges added to my account.I wrote to the Ombdsman in August 2023  stating that OVO had still failed to supply some of the Bills and were still demanding meter readings which I had repeatedly given them.

The rest of the money and billing was still outstanding and I had to re file another complaint. Which the next case handler ignored most of and got parts wrong.  I was unfortunate enough to be allocated another handled who also works with  “Davies resourcing”, “Lancashire county council” and “PFP Energy” who took over the case but never completed it , was supposed to issue a post decision but never did, and ignored all my messages regarding it and never answered her phone messages or emails.Her supervisor also miraculously disappeared having had a 2 hour convo with my daughter promising she would be our point of contact from now on then never spoke to us ever again despite promising us she would be there to see it through after the case handler couldn’t be bothered to. They never bothered to respond to messages in the portal nor voicemails and never picked up the phone or correspond with me at all. I guess that’s “home working” for you. How do I get a job being a “case handler” as I could use the downtime & extra money??After ringing the energy ombudsman repeatedly for the past several months and being told that they can see on the notes that my callback requests have gone unanswered and saying they have no idea why the case handler is ignoring me, and promising to escalate it to their supervisor still no update. I guess their supervisor doesn’t take issue with her not doing her job as I never got an update nor an apology for my mystical disappearing case handler.All of my emails to the executive office, the ceo and enquiries email are totally ignored now, as are my multiple formal complaints which have been consistently ignored and gone unanswered.Every time my daughter phones it’s just lip service and no action.Complaint EG152500-23 remains unresolved years after I filed my initial complaint against this company.This service is an absolute insult and a joke and never enforced any of the remedies they came up with which remain outstanding and I never even got the compensation which was supposedly paid into an energy account that has been closed for months and that the company actively blocked me out of which was repeated multiple times in the case and raised with the case handler  who ignored that issue and the fact that there is no access to receive the compensation I was due, nor has the remainder of the money overpaid by me ever been refunded.Since the ombudsman have elected to ignored every single email I’ve ever sent we shall see if they have anything to say here about this poor show and ignoring complainants for months and failing to respond to my formal complaint repeatedly????? Case EG152500-23UPDATE: still not had a callback from a supervisor but they’ve tried multiple times to get this review taken down immediately after it was published, it’s very telling that they spent time trying to censor my factual review but didn’t bother to answer my complaint still.

Everything has been a mess, and now (December 2023) I have been told to complaint again against OVO Energy. I tried to complain again, but my account has been blocked - I have sent an email to enquiries, but I do not expect any answer. - I had previously complaint against the Energy Ombudsman, and their answer was that they did not 'feel' I was right, which would obviously have implied accepting their gross mismanagement and collusion with OVO corruption. I guess that now judges in UK sentence people based on their feelings rather than on the evidence? The Energy Ombudsman did not bother to go through the evidence, and did not even know the amount I had had to be paid by OVO, amount that OVO now claims back. So it means you agree to something with the Energy Ombudsman, they declare the case as solved, and then OVO can backtrack. And the Energy Ombudsman will say that that is not their problem. Hard to believe. I think it is quite evident the collusion between the Energy Ombudsman and OVO. It is sickening their trickery, ill-will, and mafia-like tactics.

United Kingdom,25,1,01-May-23,5,2,2023,The power company enablers,"Very disappointed, unfortunately not a company for the customer and more a company for the energy companies in my experience. Went from over £600 in credit to over £2000 in debt from feb 2023 to nov 2023 (thats how long it's took scottish power to sort this). Numerous emails, phone calls and live chat to try and originally try and find out why i was over £600 in credit for me to all of a sudden be over £600 in debit after putting new meter readings in for the three month period. Obviously no response ombudsman couldn't get involved and i had to wait, they finally did and ruled scottish power had to put £100 on my account and sort a payment plan to get this debit sorted. I was contacted by scottish power ombudsman in june and sorted a payment plan but told the money may come out a whole month before it should and told what to do if it did so. This information was emailed to me, the money did come out early so i did what scottish power had told me, this information they had gave me cancelled the payment plan and direct debit we had set up. This then got scottish power to send a debt collection company on to me even after asking said scottish power ombudsman about this being cancelled and was told that she was sorting this which she hadn't and i soon had an email from someone else saying the person i had been speaking to was off ill now and was only told i had cancelled the direct debit(i only did what they told me). This lead to me having too email said debt company and prove scottish power had emailed me the incorrect information hence why direct debit was cancelled luckily this was proof enough and the debt company worked with me until i had involved energy Ombudsman AGAIN! on the same case, sent all this proof about what a mess scottish power had created and clearly were incapable of giving correct information. This was july and in September i was told a decision had been made by energy Ombudsman and to my disbelief the outcome was the same as last time £100 on account and sort a payment plan out! The debt being up past the £1800 mark now. I received a voicemail to ring the person who made the decision on a thursday unfortunately i had work and had to clear my head with scottish power clearly getting away with this. I tried for over a week to phone this guy and i kept getting an answering machine. Luckily got a response from a nice lady and then afew days later an email saying case was being looked at by someone else within the same hour apparently a decision was made and it was exactly the same £100 and a payment plan i was in absolute disbelief and i had also wasted over a week trying to talk to previous guy. Obviously a company thats paid off by the companies  i cant think of anything else. There's definitely no way a company that's apparently for the customer would look at this case(two times) each time getting worse and give the same outcome, it's pretty much like them saying ""yeah that's fine not contacting them and do what you want"" as that's pretty much what they have done.

United Kingdom,5,1,22-Oct-23,10,4,2023,"Is this extreme performance due to: Incompetence, arrogance, overload / too busy or poor training?","Update FYI.  Sat 25/11.  3 weeks after complaint directly to EO in detail I have not had the basic elementary courtesy of any reply.  Mr Dodman has ignored me.  EO has failed to implements its own complaint procedure.  EO claims to it replies to all negative reviews in less than a week.  That claim is clearly false - there is no reply to me or to Trustpilot following my review.  That is because EO cannot excuse its multiple failures but does not need to - it is not accountable.  This arrogance suggests it will never reform but with a secure income stream from its monopoly the moral hazard means that the 50/50 lottery of incompetence will sadly simply continue.  See also my previous update on Mon 6/11 when I reported that the ‘Energy Ombudsman’ (EO) response to both my complaints & Trustpilot review is to close the case.  It reminds us of our grandchildren hiding their eyes - if they can’t see & anything then it isn’t there.  One paradox is Mr Ed Dodman again asks me for  more ‘feedback’, despite my previous reponse and review, which is ignored.  Is this is a consequence of systems that are excessively ‘automated’, to reduce costs & increase margins by eliminating competent human management?  The evidence is plain from over 4000 reviews - the EO process is a 50/50 lottery.  Will this flawed monopoly organisation actually do anything about to provide a competent service to the consumer.  What action will OFGEM take, or is the also flawed ‘regulator’ not bothered, as long as the ‘boxes are ticked?  EO told me by email on 9/10 that my complaint was fully resolved & Mr Ed Dodman - Director asked me to complete a survey with 2 Qs & referred me to Trustpilot when I finally replied 4/11.  Because on 9/10 my complaint was under appeal as clearly logged on the Portal, yet EO had not replied to my detailed catalogue of factual errors!  Sadly this is yet more incompetence, that has also not been explained.  I didn’t even get the ‘boiler plate’ meaningless rhetoric I now read in the EO prompt replies to some negative reviews.  So on 4/11  in the survey message I wrote:  Dear Mr Dodman.  I am extremely dissatisfied for reasons that are fully detailed in correspondence both email & Portal Ref EG153297-23.  Please will you email me so I can appraise you directly.  Or do you remain hidden from the public you attempt to serve?  I shall be involving the Independent Assessor.   Note that even your survey has errors - in Q2 there is no ‘0’?  And there are only 2Qs!  Does anyone read or check your output.  The average level of basic competence appears to be very low?  No wonder 44% of Trust Pilot reviews are the lowest = 1* with 46% 5*.  An extreme ‘V’ distribution showing the EO service is a 50/50 lottery depending on the competence of the person(s) allocated. Sadly I drew the very short straw with N Cassidy 02038358290 & “Coach” R Berry.   I look forward to hearing from you by email.  C J Green.  And, even more sadly, Mr  R Berry “Coach”, who is the claimed ‘independent’ appeal reviewer, only added to the errors because he clearly could not have read the factual evidence.  But the odds of getting a competent process are only 50/50.  My appeal was on the basis of evidenced facts, not subjective disagreement with the amount of award.  Perversely EO had upheld service complaints and awarded £125, which was fair.  But OE had rewritten, redefined & limited my complaint, Thus ignoring the fundamental issues of billing / contract errors made by EON Next dating back to 2021 & Jun - Aug  2022.  R Berry cannot have read the file, such are the glaring factual errors the appeal added to those already made by N Cassidy. So it seems EO has a culture where mistakes cannot be admitted - let alone corrected.  But EO & it’s parent Trust Alliance are not accountable in any meaningful way & once appointed have a quasi monopoly with a guaranteed income from the industry who pay a fee for each complaint.  So it’s a ‘moral hazard’, since EO is not really concerned about customer service with no real incentive to encourage the energy suppliers to improve theirs.  What chance is there for the consumer?  So great if you are in the positive 50% but bad luck if in the other half.  I will review again to report if EO actually takes any real action in response to these comments, but I am not holding my breath.  C J Green",No,01-Jan-00,,-45219

You called our complaint a fair & consistent outcome. OS is a joke and part of the Telecoms SCAM. I have never encountered such an inept and corrupt service.We were advised by O2 Business to contact Ombudsman Services as we believed we were being Scammed nearly £5000 by ICE COMMS for cancelling a Business mobile phone contract within 48 hours. Read ICE Comms 1 star reviews on Trustpilot you will see this is a regular occurrence not a one off.These people are not in the Telecoms Business to provide telecoms they are just out to financially rape their customers. Criminals working the B2B Contract loopholes!We cancelled a Business Contract for TWO mobile phones within 48 hours which were electronically signed and dated incorrectly by ICE Comms senior account manager. As this is a Business Contract you do not get a 14 day cooling off period with a third party supplier as you do with the main network providers like O2 Business Contracts (Be warned they won't advise this!!!) If they get a Contract you are trapped! ICE Comms In-house solicitor admitted they put the wrong date on the alleged electronically signed Contract, how does that happen when the customer is suppose to sign, date and initial? NO Contract was ever provided with the correct date of the alleged ContractO2 Business advised us to cancel immediately which we did they also tried to help resolve the issue they got us into with their so called trusted partner! ICE Comms would not speak to it's trusted partner O2 as they claimed they were not the customer only the network provider. O2's high-level complaints officer did not understand any of their charges! O2 did eventually get through to ICE and they offered to reinstate the alleged Contract but their in-house solicitor Grimes required £2,000 legal fees paid upfront. We would NEVER enter any Contracts with Ice Comms or the Leasing company they use for devices! Please note O2 paid £75.00 for their bad advice about one of their so called trusted partner. We believe Misrepresentation and Concealment took & takes placeThese fraudulent Telecoms companies all seem to be running the same or similar SCAMS. They target small businesses as there is limited to no legal protection from their SCAM. They make serious amounts of money get caught out or go into liquidation as this company did and start up all over again under a new name. Companies House tells their story. Watchdog needs to investigate the Telecoms industry to bring this serious SCAM to an end!ALL email quotes sent from ICE senior accounts manager states in LARGE yellow font £54 a month for 36 months - Misrepresentation! They send a Airtime Contract where they conceal the real price when they remove so called discount at the 18 month point! No discount was ever offered in any email quotes - Concealment! We know this company is catching many small businesses out with their Contracts and UNFAIR T&C's 18 pages so make sure you read every page within the phone call.

We know OS has and will have many more complaints. No handsets, No O2 network, No service, No Contract with correct date or anything were ever provided apart from constant threats from their In-house solicitor to pay their extortionate termination fees (his wages). This SMALL Comms firm employs an In-house Solicitor for a reason, it is called ""Breach of Contract"".Ombudsman Services agreed a Contract had been signed dated incorrectly and returned to the Comms supplier regardless who signed electronically and put the incorrect date on so we were bound by their UNFAIR T&C's and see no valid reason why these charges should be reduced or removed - Really! NO one would ever agree to their UNFAIR T&C's in the right mind!! We had to pay 3 times what the alleged Contract was worth for absolutely nothing. SCAM!As stated multiple times to OS the alleged Contract was signed dated and initialed electronically INCORRECTLY by the supplier!

United Kingdom,16,1,29-Dec-20,12,4,2020,"From my experience, comes across as protectionist towards its clients who pay for it","It's very heartening to see so many happy customers, but my experience of the Energy Ombudsman is quite different - in fact, I am coming to the conclusion it is a protectionist organisation. I am a very low energy user, especially regarding gas - my monthly reading for gas is around 8 units in the summer and less than 20 in the winter. However, with three successive energy companies - including that cuddly sea creature that trumpets its own Which recommendation as if it walked on water rather than swam in it - I made a complaint to the Energy Ombudsman, only for them to close down my case. In one other case, I would say the agent I spoke to was downright hostile towards me and then closed down my case. The problem is that once that cuddly initial tariff is over, energy companies have a habit of adding a preposterous sum to your bill without warning or explanation. It is, I have noticed, usually around £400. No warning - just an invoice or you suddenly realise you are no longer in credit, but in debt to a shark. You get told all sorts of tosh about your usage, or projected usage - in case you might decide to open up a solarium in your box room in the next 12 months. On this occasion, the cuddly creature I was on dual energy with not only raised my direct debit by £18pm month after the initial tariff ended - they managed to eliminate within four weeks a £185 credit on the account and then - despite my low gas usage - added £353 to my gas account for good measure later. Over the summer quarter I was charged £623 in energy - which they do not deny, but claim it is my fault because during the initial tariff period I never contacted them. I didn't speak to anyone. They were obviously upset at being ignored. I reported it to the Energy Ombudsman who decided they could help me, so I sent in reams of correspondence and account details, only for the complaint to be immediately shut down with no explanation. I had had enormous trouble logging into their website and this had prevented me for a long time from actually adding the details they kept requesting from me. They managed to request this, but not respond to the emails I kept sending saying telling them they had not sent me the code I needed to log in to add the details. After a couple of months of this I finally was given a code and could log in and add the papers they wanted. But then the claim was immediately shut down because they could not help me. I was told to log in to see why - there was no one I could contact to ask why. And, of course, my log in details no longer worked. I was gaslighted by both the cuddly sea creature and the cuddly sea creature's Ombudsman, who, of course, is paid for by the cuddly sea creature. Result - I paid £623 for the summer quarter of energy usage, at least half of which was for gas even though I was using a maximum of 8 units per month. For some reason, the cuddly sea creature also had an inflated gas reading for me, which was my fault, naturally. That reduced my overspend by £123. But did not account for where the £185 credit on the account and the £353 addition plus the extra £18pm DD went. Straight into Davy Jones's locker.   The  Energy Ombudsman also shut down a complaint I made some years ago when another company suddenly sent me a bill for £400 as an ""overspend on account."" I contacted one of their agents and was told the new estimate was the equivalent usage for a four-bedroom house.  I live in a small one-bed flat. Again, the complaint was simply shut down - so imagine my surprise around six months' later when the Ombudsman decided to hand out refunds to unhappy customers of the same company for the same added charges of roughly the same amount. But not me. Again, exactly the same thing a few years later - an inflated charge, my case shut down immediately, then other customers were in the press getting their refunds. So my fear about the Energy Ombudsman is that it does not offer all consumers a level playing field regarding complaints - and certainly it seems if their agents don't like the sound of you on the phone, or perhaps how you come across in correspondence as you fight your corner for what are not inconsiderable sums of money, they will protect the companies which pay for their very existence. This is plainly unfair. It implies a protectionist attitude towards companies that may be profiteering and targeting certain customers because they have low usage, do not appear to be engaged in their billing or tariff levels - and perhaps live in an area of the country that is, as in my case, perceived as ""wealthy"" and therefore more likely to pay up and put up. That is very definitely the impression I got both from the energy companies I was dealing with and the Energy Ombudsman: that certain companies are lauded and even protected and certain consumers are not - they are simply dismissed and their claims shut down.",No,01-Jan-00,,-44192

It failed to add one word of criticism of BT's actions and hid behind the mantra that since Openreach is now a separate company it is beyond OS's remit to comment on it. This ignores BT's responsibility to manage the service it provides to customers and means that it is useless to go to OS for any complaint involving Openreach.

I was thankful I could turn to Ombudsman Services again. Though this time, Ombudsman Services have been a disgrace. Absolutely appallingly awful. I wish I'd never contacted them, as they've caused more stress and only added to the problems, wasting hours and hours of my time. I've dreaded receiving e-mails from Ombudsman Services. They've driven me into submission, and I've given up after 7-8 months, deciding to accept a paltry compensation offer rather than taking it any further.Staff I encountered either have little knowledge of what they're investigating, don't care to investigate properly or both. They make a mockery of the word ""investigate."" I never like to place blame on individuals, and there seems to be something seriously wrong at the company. I'd speculate perhaps in terms of training and/or how targets are set. Staff seem to have no pride in their work or in making any attempt to do their job properly, and one staff member had a very poor attitude.I complained/appealed after the first awful OS investigation this year - I can't remember the numerous issues, but even evidence I spent time uploading was ignored. Another staff member investigated. The second investigation was worse than the first, stating problems I'd apparently mentioned that I never had and ignoring comments I'd made about problems with the previous investigation. So I complained again, which meant another investigation, this time by a senior member of staff (so I was told). Completely useless again. Looking in from the outside, the staff seem like they're trying to protect each other from any kind of criticism, so if someone makes mistakes on an 'investigation' the other staff back those mistakes up as correct. The long and mostly pointless Word documents they attach to e-mails are garbage. There are other negative things I could mention, like the poor usability of their reporting website, the fact they constantly called me by the wrong name (even when finally offering the compensation) and more, but the attention should be on the terrible overall service I was provided.I see OS responding to negative reviews with comments like ""In the nature of dispute resolution there will always be an unhappy party,"" as if that's meant to justify their appalling service in some way. Based on my experience, I don't believe anything they say.Given they only exacerbated problems, I wish I could give them a minus rating.

United Kingdom,36,1,15-Feb-20,2,1,2020,91% Bad Reviews!,"Just don't bother, they really are out for their affiliates.The ombudsman-services are a complete waste of time and based on my experience they enabled Managing Agents to behave with complete negligible impunity. Several cases all ruled in favour of the Agents when I clearly detailed negligence. Don't waste your time with them, they are just a front for their affiliated members.After conversations with employees (who appear to be entirely incapable in the function as an impartial investigators) I asked them to explain why a property agent who had failed to trace the source of a 10 year old leak had performed ""above and beyond"" what they are expected to do! It was like speaking to an uneducated robot, being met with a repetitive groan of ""you need to put your complaint in writing"" again!! Steadfastly unwilling to explain herself before slamming the phone down on me. It’s just a ridiculous and pointless body. The problem as I see it is that they’re simply not impartial. Funded by their members they are clearly biased towards retaining their affiliation fees.I then spoke to a senior supervisor who supposedly manages the individual who was defending their paid affiliate so blatantly. Anyway, again - refused to discuss how they came to decision. Absolutely unwilling to explain how based on the evidence provided they arrived at their verdict. Approached the whole matter subjectively and shuddered at any questioning that dares suggest they've made errors or even still to explain their complete incompetence. She was clearly there to defend her colleague and made no effort at all to understand why I was querying such a biased decision. They are simply enabling rogue affiliates and making consumers jump through hoops providing information without having the professional nouse to even discuss any decision making. After multiple cases, all found in favour of their paid affiliate, what I found very odd is their utter refusal to actually discuss each case verbally. They then ask you to provide more evidence should you challenge anything but without knowing exactly what they have based their decision on how can you know what more to provide them. They then send threatening correspondence about closing the case if evidence isn’t provided thus manoeuvring the consumer into an impossible situation. Win, win for the OS and their paid affiliate. I did complain about the service I’d received by the investigating officers and their decision making, lack of clarity or explanation, misleading information, the lies, the slamming of phones etc. I didn’t expect to get anywhere and I was right. Again they were only interested in finding the consumer in the wrong as usual. Oh but someone then called and offerered £25 to acknowledge the ‘inconvenience and frustration we have caused’ as a full and final settlement of the complaints! Months and months of inconvenience and incompetence summed up in a £25 bribe! I’ve lost £1,000’s!In my experience of dealing with these people I would strongly advise people not to bother. The process is very time consuming and wasteful and you only have to read what is being published on here to know what your outcome will be. They will rule in the favour of their paymasters. Why wouldn’t they, they are in effect their employers. They will probably continue to operate as they are serving their paid affiliates. If this was consumer funded it’d be closed down by now as it’s clearly not fit for purpose.Note to Trust Pilot. I see the OS are trying to disassociate themselves from the fact they used to offer property resolution. I have evidence to support this Ombudsman carried out the investigation(s). I can produce all evidence required. The fact they have had to dissolve themselves from being a property Ombudsman is irrelevant given this was a service they previously offered, albeit very badly.

United Kingdom,1,1,08-Oct-19,10,4,2019,Totally incompetent,"My query was about a faulty electricity meter.The meter is proven faulty, eventually accepted as faulty by the electricity company, displayed all kinds of errors, failed all the tests and has now been replaced.My measured usage has dropped by 50% with the replacement meter.There is no doubt the meter was faulty.There's way too much to report here about the ombudsman's handling of this complaint but, among the total garbage, the Ombudsman service told me the following.The OS says that on a meter 3,200 flashes equal 1 kilowatt hours.This is just some figure plucked from thin air.There are 1000 flashes of the meter to a kilowatt hour and it says so on the front of every meter.No wonder the OS thought my meter was normal when they're out by a factor of 3 or more with their figures.OS told me it is reasonable to assume, if you believed your meter was faulty that you would have contacted the Electric company further. How many time does a meter need to be reported as faulty? Surely once should be enough? I reported it 4 times but apparently the OS doesn't consider it reasonable to ""only"" report the fault 4 times and requires faults be reported more often to be considered as real faults. This is a good one.The OS told that me While the usage itself may not be accurate, the readings themselves are accurate as they are from your meter.So the Ombudsman thinks that a faulty meter still gives accurate readings! They then used these supposed ""accurate"" readings to justify claiming that the meter wasn't faulty after all. This is unbelievable incompetence.My meter fault was intermittent, worsening with time, but the Ombudsman tells me a that meter cannot self repair, therefore if it was faulty it could not then start working then become faulty again.So the OS has dismissed the possibility of an intermittent fault, the most common type of fault in any electrical equipment.The OS refuses to accept the most common type of fault exists, doesn't accept any kind of fault exists unless it's reported more than 4 times, doesn't know what a unit of electricity is and thinks faulty meters still give accurate readings.This service is really not fit for purpose.It needs properly trained staff to handle complaints, preferably staff that know what a fault is and what a unit of electricity is.Finally, the OS tells me there is no opportunity to appeal.Even if there was an opportunity to appeal I wouldn't take it.

To go back there every month and let in a meter reader so E:on can take their own readings.I live 80 miles away from the empty property and have no money so how exactly this is a fair remedy to me I have no idea.I thought that the Energy Ombudsman was suppost to make sure that Customers were treated fairly.

I am now going to have to go to the small claims court as I am not paying for energy I have not used, nor am I paying for a standing charge as I am not using any energy.E:on have even changed their Standing Charge Policy so that they do not have to remove any standing charge for anyone.

United Kingdom,1,1,24-Aug-19,8,3,2019,SCANDALOUS  TRUTH -  NOT AN OMBUDSMAN AT ALL,"TIME FOR CHANGE - GET RID OF THIS DELIBERATE PREVARICATING NOT FIT FOR PURPOSE NONSENSE ""Ombudsmen Services Limited"" is utterly useless and actually worse than useless in that its pooorly implemented almost non existent powers delay and exhaust all consumers that are vulnerable to the considerable corporate might of the energy utility suppliers.    ""Ombudsman"" is a Swedish word and means “representative or agent of the people”. Sweden had the first ombudsman in 1809 and other countries used the word when they appointed Ombudsmen of their own.  This was a very commonly understood  definition of what any “Ombudsman” would be in the UK and various  ""Ombudsman"" have operated under independent auspices in different areas of government, commerce and industry for many years.  Ombudsman Services Limited were conveniently formed (popped up?) in 2002 doubtless to sate the craze of taking as many consumer representative powers and overheads as far away from the government and the privatised utility companies as possible Their mission statement states : “We’re not a watchdog or a regulator – our job is to resolve complaints - so we can put consumers back into the position they were in before the issue occurred. We also work to help businesses understand their customers, so they can serve them better and resolve problems faster.”  The validity of this statement is not just questionable based upon the injustice they cause to consumers from their own atrocious maladministration and service level failure, but also from the pathetically low maximum compensation limit of £5,000k (as far as we know never ever paid out.)   They certainly are neither fast, nor efficient, nor appropriately knowledgeable of the energy supply engineering, technology  or accounting disciplines they are supposed to be able to investigate to provide resolution to the lay consumer.   Even the actual Ombudsman/woman (allegedly) has a fearful reputation for  “completely missing the point” and strangely doing so in writing even when signposted to grave injustices caused by her offices (one really couldn’t make it up) READ ON   Unfortunately in the case of the UK privatized  utilities,  the very structure of government regulatory processes somewhat bizarrely provides protection of the large utility companies which is actually against the very consumer's interests that they were set up to safeguard.  Although a condition of privatisation of the utilities that proper protection was put in place with court powers of sanction and compensation these were rapidly debrided in no less than 5 re- namings and reorganisations in over 25 years- 1. Gas and Electricity Consumer Council2. Energywatch 3. Consumer Direct 4. Consumer Focus  5. Consumer Futures 6. Citizens Advice Consumer Help Line  7. Citizens Advice Consumer Help Line  Extra Help Unitthe last two now sit confusingly and truly ineptly next to the “Energy Ombudsman” as the only utterly toothless and hopeless consumer representation that remains  In the case of the energy utility companies  the so called ""Ombudsman"", or ""Energy Ombudsman"" or more properly titled  ""Ombudsman Services Limited""  is certainly not a representative or agent of the people so should not be referred to as an ""ombudsman"", at all.The reality is that ""Ombudsman Services Limited"" are a private limited company directly funded by the membership of the energy companies. They have  a proven track record for taking most advantage of the complete absence of the most even handed processes in the courts arbitration or mediation, of things like ""discovery"", to avoid proper transparent review of  consumer evidence, invariably leaving serious claims unexamined with nominal slap wrist ex gratia payments allotted to the consumer which are very seldom in any way proportionate to the actual financial loss as a serious injustice caused, nor anywhere approaching even their own disproportionate  compensation limit of £5,000.A. A simple comparative example of this, is where the consumer is obliged to endure the lack of powers (or will) of the Ombudsman Services Limited which despite professing independence and consumer dispute resolution, do not operate with anything close to the even handed processes of evidence discovery , objective evidence interrogation / investigation and simple adjudicating powers of the UK law courts or other reputable dispute resolution bodies. – Why not?B. The so called “investigation” undertaken by an “investigator” is nothing of the sort – It is a paperwork desktop study without all of the open discovery or examination of evidence or contact of witnesses one would reasonably expect to be essential to an investigation especially with often statutory, or technical best practice, matters at stake.C. Although Ombudsman services claim that if a utility company fail to respond to them within a standard timeframe they will continue to make a judgement without them – in many cases the energy utility suppliers are allowed to grossly exceed this timeframe without sanction.D. Where they fail at a procedural level they are supposed to be reviewed by The Independent Assessor, but even this is experienced as an unresponsive joke.The government has been approached by consumer champions like Martin Lewis to change this sham, but has done precisely nothing about it - the consumers themselves with major cases are not even consulted - it is all a self serving talking shop - NOT FIT FOR PURPOSE -  GET RID",No,01-Jan-00,,-43699

If they don't, that really does tell you all you need to know about this outfit's approach to integrity. I mean, why on earth isn't there a link to TrustPilot on their website if they're such advocates of transparency? Maybe that would be a tad too difficult to explain, though?Also, while we're on the point, why on earth is a self-avowed ""complaints handling service"" offering to provide ""LOBBYING"" services (i.e. offering to seek to influence policy and legislation) to its, ahem, ""partners"" (""partners"" is a silly little euphemism for ""paying customers"", btw: OS is THAT corrupt they can't even bring themselves to call them what they are).Note that while OS is seemingly happy to assist companies to LOBBY it is at absolute pains to stress it is NOT a ""consumer advocate""... how on earth can it be acceptable to SELL LOBBYING SERVICES  to commercial entities - i.e. RECEIVE PAYMENTS OF MONEY TO PROVIDE ADVOCACY SERVICES - if acting as a ""consumer advocate"" is apparently verboten? presumably because OS charges companies £££ for its lobbying services?

So I'll gloss over the lack of replies, lost evidence, missed deadlines, closing my case to say that no complaint had been logged at British Gas AFTER me sending them a copy of the deadlock letter etc, etc, etc...In short, there was finally (months late) a ruling 'in my favour' which still leaves British Gas doing exactly as they were before, so I made a service complaint against OS which went in my favour, as the trail of devastation caused by their incompetence was clear. They continued to make the same mistakes, despite agreeing with me that their service was ""disappointing"" (a phrase which came up often).I made a complaint to their Independent Assessor, who also found in my favour and ruled that OS themselves had to pay me £100 (not the first time). She ruled that they had ignored crucial evidence including a 5000 word letter I had written, outlining every detail they had missed previously - their 're-investigation' was the exact same findings again, and when I questioned it with Owen, a 'senior investigator', he told me that he didn't need to review the evidence, as ""I have dealt with such complaints before, and on balance of probability I feel I know what the issue likely is"".

Of course, £50 doesn't resolve the problem in the first place. The anomaly of a person astonishingly gaining a satisfactory outcome is the fallback of any OS reply.Advice for future users of OS it inst impossible to have OS find in your favour but it is difficult, written evidence is the most beneficial (post or email) as then you have an evidence trail of escalation. Photographs always help and if you are in the position to do so - call recordings (with call handler consent).Lastly, OS cannot litigate against the companies it serves, you will need a scc/solicitor for that.

United Kingdom,2,1,29-May-19,5,2,2019,Rigged from start to finish,"This organisation is not fit for purpose. Like many other reviews on here they seem geared toward protecting energy providers interests rather than the protecting customers.Below is the synopsis: (the full story is very long and frustrating!)During a switch between OVO energy and British Gas there was a discrepancy of the amount owed to OVO. OVO's contact has been horrendous and mostly none existent throughout including passing an erroneous debt onto a debt collection agency. I instantly contacted the debt collectors and OVO and started a read dispute. I was given a time frame of ""up to 12 weeks"" to resolve this. It was resolved within this time frame and the matter had ended. Nearly 2 years after I left their service OVO again threatened debt collection for a small amount. They also informed me that this may have affected my credit rating. I instantly paid the small amount out of fear for my credit rating - I then filed a complaint and asked for my details to be removed by OVO after the complaint was addressed. I was given a time frame by OVO for a response which never came. I chased OVO up only to be told they had deleted my details and could no longer help resolve my complaint. Ombudsman investigation:This is where Ombudsman services come in. After receiving my letter of deadlock I've spent hours and hours putting my detailed evidence together with all the communications I had before Ombudsman's deadline. The Ombudsman missed their initial deadline for a decision so I chased. OVO couldn't provide any real evidence as it had been deleted. They could demonstrate some account memos and when some actions happened on my account but not the content of such actions nor whether contact between OVO and myself had been made. The investigating officer either didn't read my evidence or wilfully ignored it barely referencing any of my points in her findings. She had ASSUMED what OVO had contacted me regarding my bill even though I could prove that on the occasions OVO had claimed they made contact with me it was for generic information about service updates. This and a few other reasons were my grounds for appeal.Appeal: I came to learn the appeal is a one shot process conducted by the same investigator (completely flawed with no new perspective and considering she had missed my evidence first time around). I rebuffed the points of the initial investigation and strengthened my main points and concrete evidence that contradicts OVO's events. After a phone call with the investigator, she said it was very detailed and clear to her what had happened. Again, another missed deadline (12 days) after the appeal was due I received a rejection for another easily refutable reason, she maintained that OVO had contacted me . The investigator claims OVO had contacted me regarding this bill but neither OVO or the ombudsman can demonstrate to me with evidence that this happened. I thought it was supposed to be EVIDENCE BASED! It's unfair that OVO can wreck someone's credit rating and get away with it through mishandling of my data and account. The Ombudsman may well not exist. The investigators level of assumption against my evidence and amount of bias shown toward OVO is a disgrace. Not fit for purpose and rigged from start to finish. Please don't bother with your generic responses on here. This matter is going to continue for both OVO and the Ombudsman.

United Kingdom,2,1,12-Dec-18,12,4,2018,Do nothing and get away with it.,"Initially the experience was pleasant; the lady on the phone understood the problem and sympathised with how I had been treated by my energy suppliers.  When it came to the decision, however, the ombudsman made critical factual errors, had ignored important evidence and had used a severely flawed method of arriving at their conclusion.To give some background, I had a single billing period where I was reportedly using up to £200 of electricity per month.  The same billing period showed usage of around £30 per month, despite being a more expensive tarrif.  I complained to the supplier and the bills immediately became normal but they denied that there was anything wrong with my previous bill and that it was normal; I must've somehow just used six times more than I normally would.  They also instantly increased my direct debit without notice from £71 per month to £231 per month.  The supplier refused to accept any mistake, refused to investigate the matter, refused to give me hourly or daily energy usage reports (on the basis of the GDPR), refused to provide a check-meter and didn't even bother to check if my serial numbers matched their system.The ombudsman deduced there was no error and offered the standard £50 for service shortfall (for not notifying me of the DD change).  Their decision looked at my annual average usage and deemed that 16 units per day was normal (despite my previous yearly average being around 8 units per day).I appealed and mentioned the errors, the missed facts and the flawed comparison of energy usage.  They simply repeated their initial response and said ""Regarding the factual inaccuracies, we were given the correct data by your supplier.  Apologies for the confusion"".So basically, they did little to no investigation, offered a derisory amount of compensation and haven't even questioned whether the supplier even has the correct serial numbers, despite the number of the meter not matching the number on the website.After some searching, I am now aware that this is the last stop for people like me.

United Kingdom,19,1,05-May-18,5,2,2018,STEER WELL CLEAR!,"STEER WELL CLEAR!! I contacted Ombudsman services as I have had a faulty (crackly and noisy with broadband drops and slow speed) telephone and Broadband service for teh last 11 months. I gave all the information to OS including the router logs and a spreadsheet of when and how the line was bad. My service is with BT and being out of contract I'm paying top price for this service. BT wwon't reduce my monthly fees unless I take a 12month minimum contract, which I won't do for a faulty service. Neither will they offer compensation until the fault is fixed. I went to  Ombudsman  Services out of desperation, once BT knew I'd gone to the Ombudsman BT would no longer enter into any discussion about compensation or fees, making the situation considerably worse.I have just received the final judgement from Ombudsman services, it's extremely verbose and difficult to read, but essentially says that BT state in their terms and conditions that they don't guarantee a fault free service and so teh ombudsman has stated that no recompense is necessary, they also state it is reasonable, with intermittent faults, to consider every fault report as a separate case. As an engineer of 30 years experience and a post graduate degree I couldn't disagree more, it is essential to log all occurrences in order to find the common factors in each occurrence. In short, getting Ombudsman Services involved has set my case back hugely, BT will carry on being incompetent in fixing the fault as they have been given carte blanche to do so, neither will I get any compensation for a faulty service either, even though this is patently in contravention of teh goods and services act. P.S.  There doesn't seem to be any way of appealing their decision.In short, unless your case is so cut ans dried a 5 year  old child could argue it for you and win, steer well clear Ombudsman Services, they will only make matters worse for you and ruin your case.UPDATE: I appealed the verdict that found no fault with BT. They took several weeks to come to their decision, I as given 8 days in which to appeal. Sadly I have to say everything about the process, other than the initial phone call which with hindsight seems designed to inspire confidence and draw customers in, has been designed to be as obstructive as possible. Others have mentioned relieving a text leading to the portal, which doesn't work well on a phone, the portal is so badly written it doesn't seem to accommodate different screen sizes, world on a desktop, not on my laptop. It wasn't easy to navigate to front the appeals section. When I appealed I was only you've 2000 characters, far fewer than the investigating officer used, so I ran out of space. No doubt I could have attached further documents but as I had little time to submit the appeal I didn't bother. Needless to say, they find in favour of BT again and i replied saying I did not accept their decision. Dealing with ombudsmen services has been far harder and more frustrating than dealing with the company I complained about. I can't help feeling there should be an independent complaint commission for the independent complaints resolution companies like this, but then again life's too short. I guess that's what there sharks rely on. All in all a very sad, 7disparaging and depressing experience, a bit like the nice one during a Stasi investigation.

United Kingdom,23,1,28-Feb-18,2,1,2018,Completely Corrupt!,"I've had the misfortune of having to use the 'independent' Ombudsman services on 3 occasions. I can honestly say they are equally as dishonest as the companies you are seeking protection from. 1) Energy Ombudsman (against SSE) - When the council changed the gas pipes in the road to plastic ones the engineers had particular difficulty making a connection to our house supply. They said it had been missed out when others had been done because it was really hard. The workers dug up the garden with no joy, then came in under the house by cutting up the floorboards in two rooms and at the end of the day left with floors broken and the electrical wiring on the gas meter hanging down. He said that part wasn't his job. After a few months & several calls someone came and fixed the 'completely unsafe' (his words) wiring but they wouldn't fix the floors. Anyway, when I received my quarterly bill for the time the work was carried out the bill was massive, about £950 (dual fuel). A year bill for us is usually about £1050 (dual fuel) and this wasn't at winter time. When it went to the Ombudsman they told me to follow the Energy company's procedure of having the meter tested. I told them it was not the meter at fault, something that must have happened when they were carrying out the work. It was really obvious that we couldn't have suddenly used all that gas but because the meter was not faulty the Ombudsman said we must pay the bill and so I had to. But they did award me £50, for some reason.2) Property Ombudsman (against E-Surv) - We got a mortgage through Barclays bank and they offered to arrange everything for us such as RICS Homebuyers Survey, House insurance etc. while handling our mortgage. It later transpired that there were some expensive problems with the house that had been missed in the report. I ended up going back to the Surveyor, just for advice on what to do to begin with, but they got really nasty and started a complaint procedure. They investigated themselves and found they had done nothing wrong. It went to the Ombudsman and the Surveyor lied through their teeth to them. Fortunately I managed to prove they were lying through photos and the strength of my case. The Ombudsman ruled in my favour and found the RICS company to be negligent. I provided several quotes from Federation of Master Builders approved companies for the cost to put the problem right (I got the quotes while trying to get the problem resolved myself, before my complaint started). The cost was around £45,000!! The Ombudsman suggested that I be awarded £100. And this is when they rule in your favour? They argued that I would have paid the same (full asking price) for my house had I known about the £45,000 problem that went unreported. Would you have? Or would you have asked for a reduced price? The law states that you should be awarded the difference. I was told that they could review the decision if I disagreed, which I obviously did. The review came back with the same verdict, only this time I was told I was not allowed to contest the decision. I advised them to keep the £100, as I did not wish to accept the (legally binding) agreement.3) Financial Ombudsman (against Barclays Bank) - I decided that I would contact Barclays to complain that the RICS Homebuyers Survey they sold me was negligent and that I was facing a bill of £45,000 to get the problem fixed. Barclays told me that it was nothing to do with them because they were a bank and didn't do surveys. I told them that they sold me one (for £675) when I took out the mortgage with them, even advising me that it would be better to buy it from them, and that it had been found negligent. They said they would look into it and phone me back in a week. After 3 weeks and no call I logged on to their complaints website using a reference they sent me and found they had closed my complaint immediately, without telling me. And so the process started again of introducing an 'independent' Ombudsman service to seek justice. First the Ombudsman told me there is no point in buying a RICS Homebuyers Survey as it doesn't mean anything, it is just so the bank can value the property. I said no, that's a valuation. I bought a Survey at a higher cost to see if there was anything wrong with the property. It is advisable to do this and even Barclays advised this was a better option. The Ombudsman persisted with this angle to dismiss my claim until it was clear I wasn't going to accept it. Next they told me that Barclays had nothing to do with the report and I should seek compensation from the Surveyor. I told them that I bought the report from Barclays and so they should accept responsibility for it. The Ombudsman was desperate to dismiss my claim, even making up things that didn't happen in order to destroy my claim, even to the point that I told them that they were obviously not independent and were clearly protecting Barclays. The Ombudsmans new angle of attack was that Barclays had only advised me of a surveyor to use and that I had done business directly with the surveyor and so Barclays weren't involved. I continually had to argue against this. They continually dismissed my claim and I continually rejected their decision. They had already asked me for proof and I had sent them the email correspondence between myself and Barclays where they clearly sold me the survey directly! The proof was indisputable. In the end they told me that I could take the Ombudsman to another Ombudsman to review the case! Guess what, the new Ombudsman decided that the other Ombudsman was correct to dismiss my case. This time the Ombudsman wrote out his full version of events. I was told that this version of events would be published on the Ombudsman public website, as the truth, and that I could not contest the verdict. In the Ombudsmans version of events Barclays had only 'advised' me to use a surveying company which I had done so myself, therefore absolving them of any involvement and/or responsibility. This was clearly NOT the truth, they all knew it was not the truth. I had given them evidence that this was not the truth, but at the end of the day they are not seeking to help you get justice they are just another smokescreen, a meaningless process to delay you and grind you down, and will always side with the corporations. I replied to the Ombudsman service by telling him that his verdict was untruthful and that I didn't want it reported as the truth on a public website. I didn't accept his verdict. I then copied and pasted sections of UK Law for him to read which described the formation of a contract, how a contract is made and how, even if a company sub-contracts work to another company THEY are still responsible for the quality of the products they sell. The Ombudsman blatantly ignored both the facts and the law when dismissing my case, telling me I could pursue the matter through the courts if I was still unhappy. After a quick check on the Ombudsman website it seems that Mr G**** M*M****, who so flagrantly disregarded my case, is a partner in M*M**** K****** Solicitors. Their website claims they are now one of the UKs largest Law firms. Perhaps Mr 'M' was looking to generate some business for his other job... Do not expect a fair hearing from the Ombudsman Service.

OS sided fully with the mobile phone provider who arbitrarily blocked certain numbers in my Wife's contacts, without explanation, but still charged the account for unsuccessful text deliveries.

The Ombudsman Services state ""The Ombudsman will decide how to consider and investigate complaints subject to the Scheme's taking account of the evidence of service failure presented and The Ombudsman is not bound by any legal rule of evidences."" This should be a big red flag to anyone. Secondly, they state (this is regarding Housing Ombudsman but their rules are same throughout the board) ""We consider complaints about Landlords responses to such reports and so do not directly investigate the reports themselves.""   What I have found is the Ombudsman services (doesn't matter which, I've encountered Housing, Local Government and Parliamentary and Health), only consider the paperwork of the organisation you are complaining about, and it trumps your evidence everytime, much of the time yours won't even get read let alone mentioned. What this means is those organisations can submit whatever they like and the Ombudsman will take it as gospel,  whether the action has been taken or not.  They are there to protect these organisations, the best you'll get is an underhanded bargain as a ""good will gesture"" in order to avoid upholding your complaint, and putting a black mark against the organisation you are complaining about.  They may even lose your complaint like the Parliamentary and Health Ombudsman did mine, and so drawing out the complaint past the three year stage of being able to get a solicitor, which is another valid point, the ombudsman service holds onto complaints for quite some time before investigatng them for me:-Housing Ombudsman held onto it for 6 months.Parliamentary and Health Ombudsman, 6 months, then lost my complaint and have still not investigated it a year on.Local Goverment Ombudsman did investigate it pretty quick, they gave the council a month to respond, made a draft decision based on the councils evidence only, which is ""standard practice,""  then mentioned none of my evidence in their final decision, evidence that made the argument the Ombudsman was relying on ""Claire Mead"" null and void,  they made a bargaining deal ""good will gesture"" instead, which the council to date have not beholden to anyway, 9 months after the investigation and so leaving me no better off. I made a formal complaint regarding the bias in the investigation but received a letter back saying that she'd followed standard practice. Hence, standard practice is biased in favour of the other party, in court both parties have their evidence considered, with the LGO they do not.  Remember there are time frames for solicitors 3 months for discrimination case,  3 years for a case to be presented and most solicitors require 6 months before the end of 3 year period to make applications to the court. So the Ombudsman likes to drag these things out as it stops you getting a solicitor.  The Ombudsman has NO ENFORCABLE rights either, so if it miraculously does find fault it cannot force the investigated party to comply and they know this, remember this isn't a legal system but a bias unjust mediatior at best. The only use the Ombudsman is to you, is for you to make a Data Protection request when you complaint has been ""investigated"" this allows you to obtain information from the other party who you are complaining about to see what they've submitted or said about you, believe me, you are going to find fraudulent documents, personal remarks, and documents withheld from investigation.The Ombudsman Services are rotten to the core, many employees are going to be ex-employees of the service you are complaining about hows that for bias? They are often on very friendly terms with eachother.  In reference to The Parliamentary and Health Ombudsman, if your case has gone past 3 year mark of getting a solicitor put the complaint and evidence in an envelope and request the NHS to keep it on file under the Data Protection Act, so that at the very least it HAS to be kept in your files. We need to end these financial black holes that the taxpayer funds and put more money into legal aid. Put it this way, if you are complaining about a govermental body (you the taxpayer funds it).

Numerous emails sent to Npower Executive complaints no response.Never had an accurate bill from them tried to charge me £700 for the actual usage cost of £67. Went to energy OS and just had their 'findings' Surprise, surprise, no mention of the false account or the unlawful cutting off of the gas which was obviouslycontrary to Npower's License. Energy Ombudsman only service Ofgem approve of so no choice now but to go to Court and Trading Standards. I'll send all the info to consumer progs and media. but the actions of Ombudsman Services (a private company) Energy are obviously deliberately covering up for Npower the company which pays for them. So much bad service by Npower, the operate as a law unto themselves. No one in authority has the backbone to deal with this behaviour.James Turner the 'investigator' emailed through three versions of his decision findings on 25th July 2016 yet claimed we had an email conversation on the 27th July, 2016 ( well, with all the other, ridiculous claims they make, they may as well say they can see into the future) He references a final bill with accurate meter readings- this final bill actually states the meter readings are  'our estimates' Further dates and amounts he also mentions are complete fiction. But at least I can demonstrate I attempted ADR. to the Courts, as that is the only option left now.Update:In his Final decision, James Turner Investigations Officer, came up with the conclusion that I had called Npower and had given them the false account name. This intimated that I had tried to deceive everyone and was trying to in some way defraud Npower.This was despite all the evidence showing it was my tenant who had called. I refused to accept his decision as it was totally flawed and full of untruths. I then applied for a copy of the evidence that Npower had supplied. They have to provide this free of charge. This evidence spelt out conclusively that my tenant had called them and showed all the details of the call. Despite several of my emails being ignored, it was not until I threatened to report them to the ICO that James Turner backed down and agreed to change that part of his Final decision and offer a pathetic apology. I sent a formal complaint to OS about the pathetic service they gave me. This was initially acknowledged and a response promised by a certain date. Nine weeks later and still waiting.

They offered us £400, on the basis that the Estate Agent was at fault, but our Legal Advisors were 'more at fault'. We complained to the Legal Ombudsman. They offered us £400, saying they were 'critical of the lawyer' but we should have explicitly told the lawyer that we were not sure whether there was Buildings Regulations approval for the loft conversion. They justified this on the basis that this was the second law firm we instructed (the first lawyers were so inept that we had to sack them)  - however, the second law firm told us they were 'starting from scratch' and charged us their full fees.

My initial complaint was that I have no service except from certain spots in my kitchen or bedroom but apparently practically having to stand on one leg to get a service is ok.  Secondly, my data started going missing in the middle of the night without any explanation but surprise, surprise O2 can offer more data at a cost-suspicious or what.  For long periods I have no network but hey O2 and the Ombudsman have no problem with that.   Despite such problems the Ombudsman finds I have do not have a complaint that they should uphold and as customers how dare we complain about paying for something and not getting it, oh the temerity of O2 customers we should be thankful for being indulged and patronised by O2 personnel and called a liar it’s the highlight of any customers day.  Additionally just recently I noticed that there were issues with the Upgrade/Refresh option whereby the cost of what is left to pay should decrease at the end of each month shockingly for my Refresh/Upgrade option was actually increasing.  Despite phoning o2 and contacting their Live Chat nothing was done, well except again I was called a liar and being told that could not happen but surprise, surprise the amounts were suddenly changed to what they should have been after the calls.    Regarding the Refresh/Upgrade cost escalating over month's and being called a liar by o2 and pointing this out to the Ombudsman it was irrelevant.  Despite being supplied with evidence they have said that it was an unfortunate error by O2.  Despite continually informing them that it was happening and being called a abused by a rude Scottish women on the O2 call line.  Now the latest response from the Ombudsman came late on Sunday night at approximately midnight and contained so many inaccurate facts and grammatical errors that I had to re-read it again several times to see what the email was actually trying to say.   The guy who wrote the email had ignored the very essence of the complaint and focused wrongly on the assumption that I only wanted an Upgrade and O2 were right not to give me one free of charge. I am shocked and not sure if he was actually responding to my complaint or whether he had mixed mine complaint with somebody else’s.  I have no idea what the gentleman was talking about he seemed to be addressing issues which I did not raise and I have to ask do they have such a workload whereby they mix different people’s complaints up, it’s the only reason I can think of for his illegible 81 sentence block of insanity.  It was so poorly crafted and written that I had to check whether it from one an oversea centre/er where English is not the first language the grammar was appalling.  Why bother making a complaint and I agree that people have to get together and lodge a complaint to have this absurd entity removed.  As has been referred to do we really expect this sham organisation to bite the hand that feeds it.  These large companies have little to fear from the Abominableman's Office when they have so much influence on the decisions being made that it’s a joke.I have just sent a number of emails to the Prime Minister etc.  doubt she will ever see them probably some faceless bureaucrat but if you don't try what's the point, its time somebody did something about this fiasco.",No,01-Jan-00,,-42987

Even the company I had the complaint with (Sky) are disappointed with the Ombudsman service I received. It seems that due processes were not followed. And in my opinion your service showed bias towards the company Sky. This is the first time I have used the Ombudsman service and it will be the last. I consider this to be a disgraceful service to the general public'.I was astounded by this statement from the investigating officer: ‘Furthermore, it is the ombudsman’s view that customers should be willing to experience some level of inconvenience and should mitigate some of their loses’. !!!So Sky were willing to give me £100 as a good will gesture in recognition and acceptance of fault but this Ombudsman organisation considered that ‘a goodwill gesture of £50 to reflect the overall experience is fair and reasonable’.In my opinion the Omdudsman service have a strange and unfair way of dealing with complaint investigations.

Basically I was being called a liar. The OS then told me BT were right to charge me all that money for leaving when, to my way of thinking,  the figure could be never be justified.

United Kingdom,6,1,28-Jul-17,7,3,2017,It is unfortunate that the Ombudsman …,"It is unfortunate that the Ombudsman service is not independent. It is portrayed as an official body to provide an independent review but the scheme can not be independent if it is funded by the company. Dictionary definition of independent:1. free from outside control; not subject to another's authority.2. not depending on another for livelihood or subsistence.Note point 2!The Ombudsman service is funded by the companies. See there wording from their website: 'Ombudsman Services is funded by the companies it handles complaints about. We charge an annual subscription fee and a case fee for each complaint we accept.'It would note make sense for them to bite the hand that feeds them!Also, if you go on to their website they publish their annual reports. There are reports for various sectors. One report showed that they uphold 29% in favour of the consumer! Very poor show really. If a person has taken their complaint all the way to the Ombudsman then they clearly have a reason for doing so. People don't complain this much with no reason. Even if the result was 50/50 you might think well there's less bias but 71% in favour of the company! The Ombudsman Service do have their own Terms of Reference which you may be able to use against them if they refuse to provide you with a fair review. You can request these from them. You can not put in a Freedom of Information Request as they are not public funded and therefore their disclosure only needs to be what they are willing to let you see.  I've had a few complaints through the Ombudsman Service. Most of the time I have to do the work for them and even when I point out all the issues including anything legal, it's a battle to get them to uphold the complaint. I had to defend a complaint for my mother once regarding PPI. The Ombudsman had refused to uphold. When she told me the issues I was furious. I called the bank myself, raised the issues and got them to resolve and apologise within 24 hours. They state they will provide the following on their website:We ensure our services are widely accessible. We base our decisions on what is fair and reasonable. When we make a decision we take into account:•both sides of the story;•regulatory rules, guidance and standards;•codes of practice, relevant law and regulations; and•what is accepted as good industry practice.I have a personal experience with bullet point one ' both sides of the story'In a recent complaint the advisor had only collected the complaint information from the energy company. I complained that her decision had been made on bias information. I pointed out 'How can you give a decision if you have not shared their file with me and given me the opportunity to respond in full.' They agreed this was not fair and so provided me with a short window to reply. My reply was extensive yet their offer to resolve the complaint actually put me in a much worse position with the company. There was also a dodgy process which had clearly happened, the company mailed out a response to me before the deadline date and before I'd even given a decline or acceptance! It portrayed to me that they'd been in some sort of cahoot. Unfortunately, until a new system is set up, is independent and transparent, consumers will have to battle on by themselves. My best advise would be check out online before you sign up to anything. Peoples reviews on these companies help others to avoid getting in a mess with them too. If you do find yourself in a mess with them then you will need to allocate some time to fight back. Get a good friend, sit in the room, research the internet, including their own terms and conditions which, are in favour of you or that are too bias and legally deemed as unfair, write a letter covering all the relevant points (with your friend so you have a sounding board) then send to either the director personally (you'll find their details on companies house) or get the contact from their chief executives office (the PA or executive team) send it to them and copy in your MP. Hopefully this should help, if it doesn't then you will have to take it through the small claims court. It might seem scary but I've done this once and won. You can put a simple file together of the points from your complaint and you are more likely to get a fairer hearing.I hope this helps some of you.

I logged a complaint to OS Services, about Vodafone over the phone. The service at this point was good efficient. I was told that I should expect delays as they had to deal with large volume of customers.2. After 4 months, I received a voicemail and an email from an investigation officer, mrs Luci.

I appealed to deputy manager level.

One complaint was submitted on my own behalf and one was on behalf of my mother. my mother had been paying a communications provider for Broadband speeds of 1.6 MB - not enough to even load a page. This company was disgraceful and they expected my 72 year old mother to unscrew a box on her wall to carry out checks herself before they would send someone out. The telecommunications ombudsman thought this was a reasonable request to make of a pensioner who knows nothing about wi-fi. The wi-fi had been originally installed for my brother who has learning difficulties but the Ombudsman thought that if my mother could not carry out these checks, then he should be able to.My own issues are too long to go into but I used CISAS and had a similarly unpleasant experience. The mantra that they tell themselves ""We are independent"" is simply untrue in my opinion and maybe they say this so often in order to convince themselves of the veracity of the statement.

These were Consumer representation bodies which  were  promised as a condition of  privatisation in the 80s/90s and now in 2017 that representation has become so cut back and reorganised renamed and disempowered over time that there was actually much better representation 25 years ago than there is now in 2017 - WHY?.  The idea of an  ""Ombudsman"" originated hundreds of years ago  in Sweden and was defined as an ""agent or representative for the people"", with the clear bent in recent decades in the UK  to provide a balancing power over the large private corporations or government bureaucracies     OMBUDSMAN SERVICES LIMITED is allegedly an intentionally misrepresentatively titled body funded directly by the private corporate utilities providing the allusion of some sort of independent  ""investigation"". This is complete b******* because there is technically no investigation at all, although it calls its staff ""investigators""They have a self serving constitution which inevitably allows bias to their funders,  which means they do not provide any proper investigation, technical or legal support or proportionate adjudication and compensation awards and certainly do NOT act as agents or representatives of the people  What they don't tell you is there is no ""discovery"" of the corporations evidence as there is in any other adjudication or dispute resolution service including mediation and the small claims court. The so called investigation is no more than a desktop paper exercise where they do not even contact often vital witnesses (statutory undertakers like a gas safe engineers who may have witnesssed foul play of the corporation would be a clear example where they simply don't/won't contact them full stop) If it were not for the development of public access to internet review sites in the past 5 year ALL CONSUMERS WOULD BE NONE THE WISER.  Sites like Trust Pilot really must grate on the government, Ombudmans Services Limited and the Utilities as their patterns of counter consumer activity are displayed for all to see.

United Kingdom,6,1,20-Apr-17,4,2,2017,We need a statutory ombudsman for surveyors,"This review relates to Ombudsman Services: PropertyMy wife and I purchased a house in 2013 and the home report identified no issues, however it soon became apparent there was an extensive damp problem that would cost around £5,000 to fix. Upon complaining to our surveyors, they offered us £1,000 (if we accepted non-liability on their part), which we felt was derisory. We appealed to Ombudsman Services: Property (OS:P) who found fault with the surveyor. However, they merely recommended the firm maintain their offer, even after appeal. Rejecting much advice to settle, we proceeded to the small claims court where we were awarded £3,000, the maximum possible damages. The entire episode lasted more than a year, was exhausting and stressful and has hampered our renovation plans. We also had to settle for less than we felt entitled to as other legal avenues could have exposed us to extensive legal costs. I can only speak of my own experience however I feel the ombudsman process currently favours surveyors as: • It is not a statutory body but funded by RICS members, who have board representation, thus it is not truly independent.• In our case, an exclusion identified by the ombudsman was clearly illogical and weighted in favour of the surveyor but it could not be challenged.• The ombudsman assesses damages based on DMV (diminution in market value) rather than the cost of putting things right, a fundamental flaw.• Even where liability is established, as in our case, the ombudsman’s approach is for both parties to share the cost equally. This is unfair, especially as surveyors will have professional insurance and are not left out of pocket.It is worth pointing out some of the findings of the OS:P’s own customer satisfaction survey from 2010/11: “Many (around two thirds) felt the report was completely or on balance against them, in line with previous years. This did not change even after further representations were made.” “Overall satisfaction levels remain low. Around two in three were dissatisfied with Ombudsman Services: Property’s handling of their complaint. Around one in two would not recommend the service and would not be likely to use it again. As a result, around two in three felt their confidence in dealing with property professionals had decreased.” The OS:P is failing to protect consumers. It is short-changing those who have suffered from the negligence of their surveyor and acting as a buffer to keep cases out of the courts. My wife and I were capable of pursuing our case, but it was a fraught experience and we still didn't receive proportionate compensation. Moreover, many other people are more vulnerable (e.g. the elderly) and they need the protection of the state. It is time that we had a statutory and truly independent ombudsman for the property services industry. To this end I have been petitioning my MP, and now MSP, for the last two years and I encourage you to do the same. The reviews here and the evidence elsewhere on the Web show that there is a deep problem with the surveying industry and their ombudsman service. They have friends in high places and it will be a real struggle to see justice done but it starts with the establishment of a statutory body.",No,01-Jan-00,,-42843

I contacted the ombudsman person to assist. But the ombudsman person took well over a year to deal with my complaint and didn't answer the phone or respond to any emails until I put in several complaints. On the last day that they had an opportunity to respond to the complaint they came back to me and said after this whole year and a half of looking into your complaint we can't find any proof that you were mis-sold. They said that the only way they could prove that I was mis-sold this if they could listen to the telephone conversation that I had when I was put onto the £80 a month tariff. They said that Scottish Power had not kept the phone records and didn't have to keep the phone records or have no obligation to keep them longer than a year. So without proof of the recording they couldn't prove it. So I wasted over 1 year waiting for that person to provide me with no information at all because when I started this whole thing They knew that it was over a year and that the telephone records would not be available so they just wasted my time.

I suspect BT is fully aware of the state of operations within the ombudsman services so raced at break-neck speed for the case to be heard that way.The ombudsman service ""claimed"" it had an unusual level of complaints and so there would be a delay of up to three months before my case could be looked at.  By any standard 3 months is totally unacceptable. When the three month time period was up I was no closer to having a case officer assigned.  I complained and was given a derisory £25 from the pockets of the ombudsman as an apology !Throughout my case I insisted that the rules of evidence be applied, I wanted to see the other side's case before anything was considered. I was rudely told by the ombudsman that rules of evidence did not apply to them.  OK let's have rules of courtesy then shall we ?Are refusing to give up I did receive case papers submitted by BT. The ombudsman then gave its decision two days later.

I cannot even be bothered to challenge the Ombudsman's decision to say that as my provider surely BT are fully responsible, and also isn't OpenReach a part of BT.There used to be a time when companies used to be afraid of the Ombudsman but now I'm afraid that they are just toothless watchdogs these days.",No,01-Jan-00,,-42807

At the same time my account migrated to OVO from SSE making things more difficult! My case was handled by one very helpful person from start to finish who understood the issue and contacted me with updates at the various stages.Luckily I had been meticulous with keeping records of phone calls, emails and bills so it was easy to provide all the evidence required to prove my case which has now been resolved. Thankfully, I now have an amended bill, an apology for their actions, as well as a credit as a gesture of goodwill for all the time and hassle I had to undergo to rectify this absurd situation.

The Energy ombudsman is farcical with regards to their powers and fines ….they say they are impartial yet they seem to give way to the wrong doings of the energy supplier, I regret ever contacting them and had I taken Scottish power to court I would have easily won £1000 plus legal fees on my straight forward case, staff are polite but the end result on your case is abysmal so say the least but as others have mentioned it takes about 2/3 months for a case to be resolved and you have to do all the leg work supplying them with evidence.

It remains to be seen if the supplier will do as it says it will. I thoroughly recommend the service.

Unknown,16,1,02-Aug-23,8,3,2023,WASTE OF TIME!,"Firstly, the website is useless! Constantly crashes and its impossible to edit anything (even when there is an error caused by the system crashing) so messages and complaint details are incomplete! Apparently staff know this and advised me to write every message/complaint in Word and then upload as a message to avoid having to repeatedly type everything! Then we get an Investigator who failed to respond to messages (both online and VM), even when hours away from a deadline, so more time wasted chasing them!Once the investigation began, it became clear that the only 'evidence' given any credibility is that provided by the organisation/company. If they have failed to log calls, or conveniently lost some records that would support the claimant, there is simply no case to answer because there is no 'evidence'. What about the evidence the claimant has? - lists of dates and names of people spoken with and failed promises, written confirmation from the organisation that confirmed actions that will be taken, but which they then failed to carry out. Apparently none of this is as credible as the organisation's records (which are incomplete). And the final insult, 'it is the consumer's responsibility to ensure the organisation carries out its duties properly'! With an all encompassing get-out clause like this standard in T&C's, the consumer is never going to win. It completely absolves companies from its obligation to carry out agreed or promised actions.  I always thought the Ombudsman was entirely independent, but the entire process is entirely skewed in the organisation’s favour.",Yes,01-Aug-23,"Hello, we're sorry that you haven't had a positive experience when using our services.

Unknown,10,1,31-Jul-23,7,3,2023,Ombudsman and Eon in it together,their reply from my last review is nonsense.  They have already said they will do nothing more so why say to message them again? they are in collaboration with the energy companies by allowing the compensation to be trivial and so no punishment for Eons atrocious service. The day I got the letter informing me of the derisory compensation amount the smart meter has started playing up.  It keeps going on and off. That was the same day I received the letter.  This is Eon being childish and yet again malicious by playing games remotely with the meter to frustrate me.  Unless it starts working properly (as it always did before) I will disconnect it as I can honestly say I feel on hatred for Eon....the Ombudsman are useless--you are in this together. It's all part of a rigged cartel to fleece the UK population and also to get poorer people in society down. Maybe the ombudsman can contact Eon and tell them to make sure the smart meter works again.

Unknown,39,1,20-Feb-22,2,1,2022,Paid for by the company you complain about so not worth using,Only interested in making sure the Guilty get away and the consumer gets to suffer. Major Companies pay to be a member of this scheme which is why they get away with failure because if the did not they would pull out and the Ombudsman would be left with no monies.,Yes,21-Feb-22,"Hi Paul, We are really sorry to hear that you feel that way. The energy industry regulator OFGEM requires all energy suppliers to be signed up to our dispute resolution service in order for them to continue to trade. Providers pay us a fee for each case we review. They pay this fee regardless of the outcome or decision we make. This means that the more complaints suppliers resolve in-house, the less they have to pay to us, which is an incentive to improve their customer service. The fee doesn't affect our decision making and allows us to provide a free service for consumers. We always aim to provide as much support to consumers as possible and should you have any questions about the decision or any next steps then please don't hesitate to contact us. Thank you",1

Being advised that this is likely to be considered by Eon, and that Eon would be obliged to consider this regulation and act upon it - Eon have decided not to and the ombudsman are backing this decision.  Huge waste of time - there is literally no recourse for the average person seeking help.  This service is not worth your time or your hope of a resolution.

Unknown,15,3,01-Jun-21,6,2,2021,Totally incompetent admin staff,"The professionalism of the investigators is totally offset by the incompetence of the admin staff, hence the mediocre rating. The Energy Ombudsman (EO) has no teeth, proposes a settlement, and then rushes to close the case based on what the energy company has told them, without checking with the complainant. I feel that a complaint should only be closed with the consent of the complainant, who is the person who initiated the complaint, and not based on what the energy company says.In my case against Scottish Power (EG074527-20), the company told the EO that they had implemented the solution, when in fact they haven't, and five months later, I'm still waiting on Scottish Power refunding me £85.03 which they are refusing to do by bank transfer since I didn't have a direct debit on the account, or by cheque since I live abroad. The EO has paid no heed to the requirement of an energy supplier to behave fairly towards its customers. Scottish Power is sticking doggedly to rigid and antiquated refund policies (who still uses cheques in this digital age?). They are a laughing stock, still rooted in the Stone Age.The EO's admin staff simply regurgitate copies of documents that the energy company has already sent me, serving no purpose. I have sometimes waited several weeks for a reply to a question from admin staff at the EO, despite them having a deadline of 5 days to reply. Also a service complaint I logged with them on 8 February 2021, complaining about their lack of action to recover my refund, was totally ignored. This is totally outrageous behaviour, attempting to quash a complaint. It is not acceptable that someone within  the EO is deleting service complaints so that admin staff can escape any potential blame or sanction.The EO is also living in a bygone age. I've never phoned them and deal exclusively online via the website which means I have a written trace of everything happening. Admin staff do not appear comfortable working online and not by phone, as the upload function does not include emails, it asks the person uploading if you're uploading a bill, a letter or something else. So the EO's systems do not reflect modern life where people communicate digitally including via email. I have mentioned this to them before, but to no avail.Also it is not possible to log a service complaint without the complainant having a UK phone number. I do not have a UK phone number, as I live abroad, and my house is for rent. This is narrow-minded, as the EO cannot seem to envisage situations where a person can be a customer of a UK energy supplier and not live in the UK.I think it is worthwhile going through the EO to try to get a good outcome. The investigators are very knowledgeable and apply all the laws, including awarding compensation where due, that most people are unaware of. Such a shame that the EO is so badly let down by the ineptitude of its admin staff.The EO has now told me that they cannot interfere with Scottish Power's refund policy as this is part of their commercial strategy. In other words, they are allowing an energy company to behave unfairly and cause tremendous nuisance to its customers. This cannot be right. An energy company's refund policy should have the customer's interests at heart, and not be structured on rigid and outdated practices.",Yes,02-Jun-21,"Hello, Thank you for taking the time to leave us such a detailed review. Our website has lots of helpful information and guidance for raising a complaint online, including what to upload as evidence and how to do this (including how to upload email trails)  When investigating complaints, our team consider multiple factors including how the supplier handled the complaint and whether the consumers level of service affected. Changing the internal processes that suppliers have is unfortunately not something that is within our remit. We work with suppliers to help them identify ways they can reduce their complaints and improve their service however, implementing changes to processes would be the role of the regulatory body, OFGEM.

Unknown,4,1,10-May-21,5,2,2021,The Most Disgraceful Decision By Ombudsman,"BULB has been overinflating my electricity estimate and I decided to recourse to Ombudsman. Shocking I got the most disgraceful decision ever.BULB admitted in their defence that they made a configuration error whilst switching from my old supplier and they apologized and were ready to pay a very little financial compensation. But my compensation request was higher than what BULB offer. I only want BULB to remove all the outrageous outstanding debit on my online account which was based on cooked up estimate. In my welcome pack, BULB mentioned the monthly estimate will be about 40pounds which is subjected to change based on the meter readings I provide.To my surprise, the investigative officer in Ombudsman was acting as the Defense Attorney for BULB. He concluded I am not entitled to any financial reward as BULB has no fault. This is shocking. Myself and BULB both admitted there was a shortfall in the customer services provided by BULB.Again the investigative officer was analyzing the electricity configuration of the BULB meter as if he was a current employee of BULB. I was so surprised by this because I cant figure out where he was getting this information since its not available in the defense document both parties presented.BULB did admitted they made a configuration error whilst setting up the meter. Again the investigative officer claim he is unable to ascertain that BULB made a configuration error. I presented a lot of documents mostly my online communication which BULB which they admitted to mistakes and also giving me conflicting informationUp till now, its still a rude shock to me.. How can Ombudsman that should be an independent body suddenly turn to Defence Attorney for BULB despite clear admission from BULB.Honestly this organisation need a complete overhaul as the citizen rights are not been protected again.",Yes,13-May-21,"Hello, We're sorry to hear that you are unhappy with the way your investigation has been conducted.

It assured me my account was closed and six months later came back with a bill for six months' electricity at the house I had left. Repeated correspondence from me only resulted in further demands from the company.

India,3,4,23-Mar-19,3,1,2019,PERSISTANCE PAYS OFF!,"I registered a case with the Energy Ombudsman after receiving the worst level of protracted customer service ever  from NPower in the U.K. Despite the fact that I had informed NPower that my account was being handled by a property management company, they completely ignored all communications from both myself and the agent, issuing estimated bills in my name for a property that was occupied by a tenant who already had an NPower account.I had assumed that I had provided all of the necessary evidence for the Energy Ombudsman to rule in my favour. This however  was not the case, as they found that I had not provided the evidence necessary to show that that I was not responsible for paying the estimated account for a period when the property was vacant i.e. a void period.They also wanted proof that the tenant had vacated the property on a certain date and wanted a document signed by both parties to say that this event had happened.I instantly appealed this decision. I knew, in law, that the documents they were asking me for was not necessary, as this requirement already existed in the signed tenancy agreement. Also I could send further proof, in the way of meter readings, emails and witness statementsI knew that.  that what I was saying was 100% correct.Eventually, the Energy Ombudsman upheld my appeal and justice has prevailed.My advice to anybody using this service would be to:1. Plan your case, make sure that you have all of the necessary information/evidence necessary to prove your argument.2. Know the law as it applies to your situation.

United States,1,5,19-Mar-19,3,1,2019,Hello,"Hello, I want to thank the Ombudsman team in supporting my EAD expedite request to the USCIS (San Jose).

United States,6,1,07-Mar-19,3,1,2019,Ombudsman Services Communications Zero Stars. Letter of Response to ‘Investigation!’,"Would definitely give no stars if possible for this totally useless service masquerading to help consumers.Copy of letter in response to Known outcome of their ‘INVESTIGATION!!!!!’WOW! CONGRATULATIONS ON UPHOLDING THREE’s MISERABLE LITTLE ROBBERY.It is barely credulous that you expect me to accept Three’s original offer after this farce. The outcome of your totally meaningless investigation was known before it started and prior to me making the complaint. I predicted with absolutely full knowledge that you would take the side of your paymasters. Shame on you Mr This is exactly why your service receives no stars in customer reviews. Despite the lies and misinformation to the contrary. You should actually be thoroughly ashamed of yourself. Your investigation is no more than utter sham. You in fact been completely blind to my complaint instead you have concentrated on the small print and the word of this egregious company of robbersThis is nothing personal against you whom I consider only ‘a dog to the machine’ and no doubt are under strict regulations to not uphold claims. Moreover it is utterly disgraceful that people have to always fight a losing battle against corporate interest. Indeed as you well know the whole Ombudsman Service is a complete sham. It masquerades as a ‘body for public good’ when it is no more than window dressing for large corporate interest. If only people on the inside had the courage and wherewithal to expose it but undoubtedly it is staffed by cowards who care more about their monthly pittance than public interest. I knew I would be disappointed when I complained to your service. Indeed I stated the outcome of your findings even before you started your ‘investigation’ into finding out how you could support Three at my expense. Anyway you have been completely successful in that goal. I am not your customer it is in reality Three whom you serve. Mr  ( if this is even your real name) you know I have been seriously overcharged yet you have still found a way to skew your findings to support of Three. Totally and utterly predictable. Moreover it is pointless to complain as your system is closed and impervious to any public scrutiny or redress and this is the reason for the brazen support the Ombudsman Services give to business. The Ombudsman Services are indeed a ‘law unto themselves’ no public accountability, no redress for complaints. You can blithely state ‘see a lawyer’ knowing full well that 99% of complainants will not do this because of the cost involved. Always protected by a hefty veneer of self righteous propaganda and toadyism.Your summary is riddled with errors and you have blatantly taken the side of Three. More deplorably you have completely ignored the overriding facts that the account was not used and Three made only a derisory telephone call to contact me. A logical impossibility when the SIM was unused. They had other ways to contact me but did not. There is nothing in your argument other than a defence of Three. It is no more than pointless gerrymandering. Moreover you talk about a notice period which is utterly crass and unbelievable. How could I possible give notice about something I knew nothing about. There are massive shortfalls in the standards of customer service but you refuse to see them and somehow twist this into it being me being at fault. It is totally ludicrous.Where does the Ombudsman Services find you people who work for this pathetic and corrupt business? Is it from Penal Institutions?Your findings and conclusions are dumb and totally one sided as of course they should be. This was a case where doing the Right Thing’ was not even considered as the mandate is always to ‘find ways and means not to uphold the claim’. People are slowly wising up to how it works Mr. It is a fabricated lie to say ‘you have considered the information from both parties’. The onus of fault clearly lies with Three. What you have done is look for ways to uphold the case for Three. It is rank hypocrisy Mr  and you know it.In conclusion THE OMBUDSMAN SERVICE CAN FOOL SOME OF THE PEOPLE SOME OF THE TIME BUT NOT ALL OF THE PEOPLE ALL OF THE TIME. This is a good message to take back to your superiors Mr As far as the tawdry payment is concerned I have no preference whatsoever. As for taking the complaint forward there is absolutely no point as everyone in the service is ‘in bed’ with each other. Too scared to rail against the system. Please do not bother to reply - my stomach won’t take any more of this complete nonsense. Just close the case and notch it up as another valiant success for the Communication Ombudsman Service.Goodbye Mr  and thank you for nothing. Just remember that you too are now complicit in the theft of an individuals hard earned money. It was a very small amount of money and both Three and your Service could easily have acted graciously and in keeping with good fiscal probity. But no this small, even tiny mistake could not be sanctioned. It must be proved at all costs the customer is at fault. Hereby the conspiracy between the Ombudsman Serices and Corporate Business begins. The customer is a mere pawn in the game by these two players who work for each other. You only too well know how the system works. Don’t you? You are part of it. I know you are just doing your job but you should really think a bit more about it!It’s all a game and a good laugh for the Communications Ombudsman Services!!!Oh and just for your information the £33 offers as a gesture of goodwill is identical to the £33 offered by Three weeks ago. Now there is a funny councidence. Talk about complicity it is ‘sheer theatre’ and couldn’t be invented. Please can you arrange for Three to send me a cheque for £33. I have no wish for a credit - maybe though I presume you are too timid to request this.",Yes,11-Mar-19,"Hello Charles.

Spain,6,1,23-Sep-18,9,3,2018,After using ofgem twice,"After using ombudsman  twice (one unfinished) I would not recommend to anybody to use this service,seems to me they listen to only one side ,it's no wonder they have a bad name I will comment again later towards the end of this month ,when dealing with them expect nothing and you will not be disappointed.....finished refused his answer to solve the problem,Scottish power took 2 years to sort out Cross meter issue,but they blamed us for reading wrong meter,national data do not tell lies ,we read the meter allocated to us , the IO said he could not find a SHORTFALL in Scottish power service and he said  £ 600 was a fair payment for 134 day supply of electricity ...I will not give up ,I looked at Money advice site and they said quote Ofgem recon a1or 2 bedroom flat would use  on average £34per month for electricity,more when I find what I am going to do .....",Yes,27-Sep-18,"HiWe are not sure if you are referring to Ombudsman Services or Ofgem, who is the energy regulator.

Unknown,11,1,19-Jun-18,6,2,2018,Avoid By All means --- This is the…,"Avoid By All means --- This is the worst Service i have ever dealt wit, its unbelievable how they lie and even if you ask them to listen to the phone recordings they say thatch not sufficient enough, i had a very bad experience with VODAFONE i actually i still have an issue with them, they investigated and came back, stating that there were no notes on vodafone on my account due to advisers not leaving any notes, i advised mark the person who was conducting my investigation that if the notes were not available to go ahead listen to the phone calls, which would bring to light a lot of the issues i was experiencing with VODAFONE, HE CLEARLY RESPONDED HE DOESN'T HAVE TO LISTEN TO ALL THE CALL AND PLUS ALL THE CALLS ARE NOT RECORDED in other words its like he was telling me to f off he doesnt have time for me. The decisions ended up falling on vodafones side, which till today i am still fighting and i wont give up. WHEN I SAY THEY ARE EXTREMELY USELESS I MEAN IT FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART. please avoid by all means most ridiculous company i have ever dealt withthe Ombudsman is corrupt and are biased toward helping the immoral and unjust organisations they are supposed to be protecting us from.Based on my experience, I have to say I agree.",Yes,21-Aug-18,"Hi Victor.

Spain,27,1,23-Aug-17,8,3,2017,As independent as a hungry teenager,"My surveyor failed to spot woodworm in 2 places - well inside our basement and just above the door to the basement.  For the latter, all the guy had to do was look up.  The Ombudsman ignored this, focusing instead on the interior, saying it was dark and obstructed by garden tools. The surveyor couldn't be expected to see anything there. Case dismissed!The Ombudsman also criticised me, writing: ""You have not provided any specialist timber and damp report.""But a few weeks earlier he'd written the following: ""You have asked whether or not you should obtain a specialist report regarding the woodworm at the property...there seems to be little to be gained by having the property inspected..""",No,01-Jan-00,,-42968
Spain,1,1,12-Aug-17,8,3,2017,Part of much wider poisonous business model,"Just had my complaint against EE dealt by this ""Ombudsman"". No sign of impartiality, full protection of the business that feeds them. The best line from their response: ""I have no evidence that EE notified you of the change in price, but I am satisfied that they did"". When I requested information about their escalation procedure and who regulates them the response was ""we will inform you about our decision in 4 weeks"". Clearly the business model is based on expectation that anyone in their right mind won't pursue this and waste tons of their time on chasing and escalating. And those who do will be isolated instances that do not spoil their statistics and ""impartial"" appearance they present to the authorities. I am afraid this is a big business and I have seen other services doing the same thing both in consumer and corporate world. It is too convenient for the industry, that outsources pain of dealing with complaints while giving an impression of an ""independent review"" and for the government that wants to be convinced that the market is self-regulated and it does not have to spend time and resources managing unhappy customers. If you look at this company on Google it does not allow ratings or comments about their service, that would spoil their stats. If it was not for TrustPilot we would all be writing comments in various different blogs which is like a drop in the ocean. A few letters to a watchdog also won't be enough to change anything. I believe we need to join forces and write a joint letter with as many signatures as possible to the Office of Fair Trading with copies to the Business Secretary, all of the signatories MPs and newspapers. If there are enough signatures we might get our voice heard.",No,01-Jan-00,,-42957

Once they did take the complaint OS did not look at the information or documents sent to support the complaint but simply took every word the company said as gospel.  They were not interested in the truth.  The information was ignored as many things said in the OS report were incorrect confirming the documents were not read.  The staff were uninterested and simply wanted to close the case rather than get to the truth and find a valid outcome for both parties.  Simply took the telecoms company line.
