Overview: 
The Energy Ombudsman acts as an intermediary between customers and their energy suppliers when disputes arise. This analysis explores customer sentiment towards the Energy Ombudsman, specifically from those seeking a second hearing on their complaint or dispute with an energy supplier. The goal was to assess how customers perceive the fairness and effectiveness of this institution over time.

Approach:

•	Data Collection: Over 4,000 customer reviews from Trustpilot (2014–2024) were web-scraped using Python.

•	Data Preparation: The reviews were exported as CSV files, cleaned, and formatted in Power Query.

•	Data Analysis: The cleaned data was imported into Power BI for analysis. A line graph visualized the average rating trend over the 10-year period.

•	Sentiment Modeling: The dataset was prepared for further sentiment analysis on the customer comments.

Insights:

•	Average Rating: The overall average customer rating was 3 out of 5 over the 10-year period.

•	Rating Trends: From 2014 to 2019, the average rating was below 2; from 2020 to 2023, it improved to 3, and in 2023, the rating peaked at 4.

•	Response Rate: The Energy Ombudsman responded to 94% of the reviews, indicating a high level of engagement.

•	Demographics: The majority of reviews came from customers based in the UK.

Recommendations:

•	Customer Dissatisfaction: Many customers seem dissatisfied with the Ombudsman's resolutions, as reflected in the lower ratings between 2014 and 2019. Perhaps, decision from the energy supplier was sufficient and fair and did not require appealing to energy ombudsman.

•	Rating Improvement in 2020: The improvement in ratings from 2020 onwards could be linked to greater empathy and responsiveness, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

•	Feedback Engagement: The Energy Ombudsman’s commitment to addressing customer feedback is clear, given their 94% response rate. However, further efforts should focus on improving resolution outcomes to enhance customer satisfaction.
